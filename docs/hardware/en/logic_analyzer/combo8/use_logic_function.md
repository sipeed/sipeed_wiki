The above diagram shows the pinout for the 8 channels of SLogic. Connect the target device's test signal points to any available CH port on SLogic, and ensure that the ground of the target device is connected to the ground of SLogic.

#### Downloading and Running the Host Computer

Click [here](https://dl.sipeed.com/shareURL/SLogic/SLogic_combo_8/4_application/PulseView) to download the latest version of the host computer software for observing digital signals and decoding. For Windows users, download the .exe file, and for Linux users, download the .AppImage file. It is recommended to download the latest version available.

Linux Environment:

1. After downloading, navigate to the directory where the software is located. Open the terminal using the shortcut CTRL+ALT+T. Then, use the following command to give the software execution permissions and run it with administrator privileges:

```bash
chmod +x PulseView-x86_64-032323-1101.AppImage
sudo ./PulseView-x86_64-032323-1101.AppImage
```

Windows Environment:

1. After downloading, click on the .exe file to begin the installation. Follow the installation prompts and click "Next" consistently to complete the installation.
2. After the installation is complete, you can find the host computer software icon in the shortcut menu. Double-click to run it.

> Note: In the Linux environment, the maximum supported sampling rate is 80M for 4 channels and 40M for 8 channels. Due to limitations in USB transmission stability on Windows, the maximum supported sampling rate is 80M for 2 channels and 20M for 8 channels.

### Starting Sampling

1. Configure the channel count, sample count, and sampling rate in PulseView.

   _In the following example, the channel count is set to **8**, the sample count is **1M samples**, and the sampling rate is **10MHz**._
   ![equ_selec_complete_of_pulseview](./../../../zh/logic_analyzer/combo8/assets/use_logic_function/equ_selec_complete_of_pulseview.png)

2. Set the trigger type for channel D0 to **Rising/Falling Edge Trigger**.

   _Click on the label icon of channel D0 to set the trigger type._
   ![set_channel_of_pulseview](./../../../zh/logic_analyzer/combo8/assets/use_logic_function/set_channel_of_pulseview.png)

3. Start the capture to obtain the sampling result.

> If you're not using channel D7 during the sampling process, you might observe a level inversion phenomenon on that channel. This phenomenon is normal and does not affect regular usage.

### Detailed Configuration

#### Sampling Parameters

Sampling parameters include the sample count, sampling frequency, and sampling time.

1. Sample Count: Choose an appropriate value for the sample count based on your requirements.
2. Sampling Frequency: Select a value greater than 10 times the frequency of the signal under test (**recommended** to adhere to Nyquist theorem).
3. Sampling Time: Calculate the sampling time based on the **sample count** and **sampling frequency** using the formula:</br>**Time (seconds) = Sample Count / Sampling Rate**</br>For example, with 1M samples and 1MHz sampling rate, the sampling time would be 1 second.

   ![set_total_sampling_time_of_pulseview](./../../../zh/logic_analyzer/combo8/assets/use_logic_function/set_total_sampling_time_of_pulseview.png)

> After setting the sample count and sampling frequency, placing the mouse cursor over the sample count selection box will display the calculated sampling time for the current parameters.

#### Channel Parameters

Click on a channel's label to set its parameters. Channel parameters include label name, label color, channel waveform display window width, and signal triggering mode.

1. Label Name: Set based on the meaning of the sampled signal to facilitate distinguishing between multiple signals.
2. Label Color: Set according to personal preference to differentiate between different signals during multi-signal sampling.
3. Channel Waveform Display Window Width: Adjust based on the signal amplitude. This value is in pixels. When the signal amplitude changes significantly, increasing this parameter can help observe amplitude changes more clearly.
4. **Signal Triggering Mode**: Choose from **Direct Sample**, **High Level Trigger**, **Low Level Trigger**, **Falling Edge Trigger**, **Rising Edge Trigger**, and **Edge Trigger**.
   (Prior to signal collection, there might be many irrelevant signals. Setting the triggering mode based on the signal pattern can effectively filter out irrelevant signals, thereby improving sampling efficiency and accuracy.)

### Debugging Waveforms

#### View Operations

Through view operations, you can observe waveforms in more detail.

![tag_of_pulseview](./../../../zh/logic_analyzer/combo8/assets/use_logic_function/tag_of_pulseview.png)

**Waveform Zoom**: Use the mouse scroll wheel (middle button) to zoom in and out of the waveform.
**Drag Waveform**: Hold down the left mouse button to drag the waveform display area horizontally and vertically.
**Region Zoom**: Double-click on a specific region to zoom in on that area of the waveform.
**Channel Scroll**: In the waveform display area, use Ctrl + mouse scroll wheel (middle button) to quickly scroll the channels up and down.
**Time Measurement**: You can create marker points by right-clicking the desired position and selecting "Create Marker Here." The software will automatically calculate and display the time length between two marker points on the time axis.
**Adjust Channel Order**: Drag and drop a channel's label to rearrange the order of channels as needed.

#### Protocol Decoding

After capturing the required data, protocol decoding can be used to analyze the data more effectively. Below are the decoding processes for some common protocols.

##### UART Protocol Data Decoding

1. Connect the TX pin of the UART to the D0 channel.

2. Click on the **Yellow and Blue waveform icon** in the top toolbar, search for "UART," and double-click to select the UART option.

   ![uart_select](./../../../zh/logic_analyzer/combo8/assets/use_logic_function/logic_uart_select.png)

3. Click on the **protocol label** of the newly added UART channel in the waveform display window.
   Set the TX corresponding channel, data format, signal baud rate, and byte order.

   ![uart_set](./../../../zh/logic_analyzer/combo8/assets/use_logic_function/logic_uart_set.png)

4. Capture the data and the decoded result will be displayed:

   Example: UART's TX pin sends data "Hello SLogic!" (ASCII data format, baud rate 115200, little-endian byte order)

##### SPI Protocol Data Decoding

1. Connect the MISO, MOSI, CLK, and CS pins of the SPI to the D0, D1, D2, and D3 channels respectively.

2. Click on the **Yellow and Blue waveform icon** in the top toolbar, search for "SPI," and double-click to select the SPI option.

   ![spi_select](./../../../zh/logic_analyzer/combo8/assets/use_logic_function/logic_spi_select.png)

3. Click on the **protocol label** of the newly added SPI channel in the waveform display window.
   Set the CLK, MISO, MOSI, and CS corresponding channels, and specify the active level of the chip select signal.

   ![spi_set](./../../../zh/logic_analyzer/combo8/assets/use_logic_function/logic_spi_set.png)

4. Capture the data and the decoded result will be displayed:

   Example: SPI sends 0x00~0x09 (clock 10MHz, low-active chip select)

   ![spi_10mhz](./../../../zh/logic_analyzer/combo8/assets/use_logic_function/logic_spi_10mhz.jpg)

   Example: SPI sends 0x00~0x09 (clock 26MHz, low-active chip select)

   ![spi_26mhz](./../../../zh/logic_analyzer/combo8/assets/use_logic_function/logic_spi_26mhz.jpg)


### Issues
1. After clicking "Run," a popup window shows the message "device closed but should be open."

    ![image-20230816113213933](./assets/tips_capture_failed.png)


    This could be due to an unstable connection leading to the device being disconnected. Try unplugging and re-plugging the device, and then reconnecting to resolve the issue.

### Precautions

When connecting the logic analyzer to the system under test, please note the following precautions:

1. The logic analyzer shares a common ground with the computer. If the system under test is a high-voltage system, be sure to use a "USB isolator" for isolation. Otherwise, there is a risk of damaging the logic analyzer or computer.
2. The GND channel must be reliably connected to the ground of the system under test and kept as short as possible.
3. The signal channels must be securely connected to the test points of the system under test. Avoid haphazard "tapping" that could introduce interference.
4. Improper wiring may introduce glitches that could prevent proper data analysis in the software.
