SPMOD_Extender(8PIN SP-MOD Expander)

## SPMOD - Extender Introduction

- Using **Sipeed-SPMOD** interface(2.54mm * 8PIN )，unified MaixPy board interface
- Using SP-Extender to divide SP-MOD into four interface，including three Two-wire SP-MOD interface and a Four-wire SP-MOD interface
- Size:35.0\*20.0\*1.6mm

## Introduction

| Features: | --- |
| --- | -- |
| Two-wire SP-MOD interface*3 | Connect to the D0 and D1 on the SP-MOD，Used as UART interface (Connect at most one device)
or I2C interface(Connect at most three device) , can also be used as two independent GPIO |
| Four-wire SP-MOD interface |  Connect to the D2-D5 on the SP-MOD，Uusually used as SPI interface，
can also be used as four independent GPIO |
| Supply voltage of external power supply | Depends on connected modules |
| Supply current of external power supply | Depends on the working conditions of the module, usually less than 1000mA |
| Range of working temperature | -40℃ ~ 85℃ |
