SLogic Combo8 features high-speed DAP-Link functionality, suitable for various common chips, especially for debugging STM32 chips using IDE on Windows.

## Enable DAPLink Functionality

Press the toggle button to switch the indicator light to green.

> To verify if DAPLink functionality is enabled:
> Linux: Use the lsusb command to check if the CMSIS-DAP HS USB device appears.

## Getting Started

Here's a step-by-step guide on using the STM32F103C8T6 chip with Windows MDK IDE as an example:

### Pin sequence

> CKLink and DAPLink have similar pin connections, so they are shown together in one diagram. Please ignore the 'CK' label.

In DAPLink mode, it can simultaneously support one DAPLink interface and one UART interface.

The pins on the left side of the diagram (TXD, RXD, DTR, RTS) can be used as a UART interface.

The pins on the right side of the diagram (TCK, TDI, TDO, TMS) are used for DAPLink debugging.

### Connecting DAPLink using MDK
- Set the Reset Options to SYSRESETREQ.
- In CMSIS-DAP, locate and select the CMSIS-DAP HS device.

### Download the firmware using MDK:

### Debug the firmware using MDK:

## Issues

1. Can't find DAPLink device

- Check if the MDK version is too low, as older versions of MDK may not recognize DAPLink. The MDK version used in this document for testing is V5.38.
- If the low MDK version is causing DAPLink recognition issues and you prefer not to upgrade, you can refer to the methods provided [here](https://developer.arm.com/documentation/ka003663/latest/) to update the debug driver for CMSIS-DAP.
