# Basic usage

## Use Dock motherboard

### Connnect Board

- We can easily note the TX and RX pins marked on the bottom of motherboard, so we can use serial port of the ttl level wo communicate with computer(Both Tina and Debian os are OK).

- For Tina OS we can use typeC cable to connect the core board with computer and use adb shell to communicate.

- For Debian OS we can use keyboard and mouse to contorl the system.

#### Notes about Debian

It may run slow because of the speed of TF card.

The users name is `root` and passwork is `licheepi`

**When using serial port connets board it always print kernel message, do following steps to stop it:**
- Edit `/etc/rsyslog.conf` by root and change `*.emerg` located in lht last line into `#*.emerg` in this file
- Restart rsyslog service by this command `/etc/init.d/rsyslog restart`

**Want to use termial in GUI**
- Use command `Alt+F2` to run "run", then input `termit` to open a terminal.

### Light LED

After succeed login OS(Both Tina and Debian are OK), we can stat blink LED.

There is an LED beside the screw fixing pad on the core board, This can be found in the dimension drawing:

</details>

And from the [schematic](https://dl.sipeed.com/shareURL/LICHEE/D1/Lichee_RV/HDK/2_Schematic) we can know the led connects with PC0 pin, and we can figure out its siginal number is ('C'-'A')x32+0 = 2x32+0=64 

We can also know the IO multiplexing table from pinmux-pins file

```bash
cat /sys/kernel/debug/pinctrl/2000000.pinctrl/pinmux-pins
...
pin 64 (PC0): device 2008000.ledc function ledc group PC0 #From this we know it connects with LED
pin 65 (PC1): UNCLAIMED
pin 66 (PC2): UNCLAIMED
pin 67 (PC3): UNCLAIMED
pin 68 (PC4): UNCLAIMED
pin 69 (PC5): UNCLAIMED
pin 70 (PC6): UNCLAIMED
pin 71 (PC7): UNCLAIMED
...
```

We export this led GPIO first：

```bash
echo 64 > /sys/class/gpio/export    #export GPIO64
```

Then we set this IO direction out, by which we can control its voltage level.

```bash
echo out>/sys/class/gpio/gpio64/direction #Set IO direction out
echo 1 > /sys/class/gpio/gpio64/value   #Set IO high voltage level
echo 0 > /sys/class/gpio/gpio64/value   #Set IO low  voltage level
```

This is the easiest way to control IO.

We shoule cancel export if we don't use this IO.

```bash
echo 64 > /sys/class/gpio/unexport    # cancel export GPIO64
```

Up to now we have succeeded Lighting led on RISC-V 64 D1.

You can also  light on the serial RGB LED ws2812:

```bash
echo 255 > /sys/class/leds/sunxi_led0r/brightness #Red led on
echo 0 > /sys/class/leds/sunxi_led0r/brightness   #Red led off
echo 255 > /sys/class/leds/sunxi_led0g/brightness #Green led on
echo 0 > /sys/class/leds/sunxi_led0g/brightness   #Green led off
echo 255 > /sys/class/leds/sunxi_led0b/brightness #Blue led on
echo 0 > /sys/class/leds/sunxi_led0b/brightness   #Blue led off
```

### Peripheral verification

#### Audio function

- Check recording device

Use command `arecord -l`

```bash
root@MaixLinux:~# arecord -l
**** List of CAPTURE Hardware Devices ****
card 0: audiocodec [audiocodec], device 0: SUNXI-CODEC 2030000.codec-0 []
  Subdevices: 1/1

  Subdevices: 1/1
  Subdevice 0: subdevice 0
```

- Check speaker device

Use command `aplay -l`

```
root@MaixLinux:~# aplay -l
**** List of PLAYBACK Hardware Devices ****

```

Play recording：

```bash
arecord -D hw:1,0 -f S16_LE -t wav -d 3 t.wav     #Recording
```
```bash
aplay -D hw:0,0 t.wav                             #Play recording
```

Besides, we can adjust volume by alsamixer application

#### USB Function

Default kernel incorporates driver for external USB flash disk. 

After Plug in the USB flash disk, you can use `fdisk -l` command to see the new `/dev/sda` device

If the USB flash disk has not been formatted, you can use `mkfs.vfat` command to format the USB disk, then mount it.

#### Wireless network

##### **Use Tina OS**
    
  LicheeRV bottom board is equipped with XR829 or RTL8723BS wifi module, can connect network by following commands:

  Add following content into `wpa_supplicant.conf` file located in /etc/wifi/ to config wifi

  ```bash
  network={  
      ssid="WiFi_name"  
      psk="WiFi_password"  
  } 
  ```

  Then restart board(Use command `reboot`), use these two commands `ifconfig wlan0 up`; `udhcpc -iwlan0`  to connect wifi.
  Then we can use ssh to remote login or use scp to transfer files by network.

##### **debian OS**

It's not supported to use command line to connect network

  Click System menu -> Preferenes -> Connman Settings，Enable Network Settings ，check whether the interface in the network property is wlan0. Double click the network name and input WiFi password to connect wifi.

  ![](./../../../zh/lichee/assets/RV/wifi-1.jpg)

  After succeeding connecting network, we can see the network IP

  ![](./../../../zh/lichee/assets/RV/wifi-2.jpg)

#### Display and touch

LicheeRV supports following screen：

- SPI screen		  1.14 inch(TODO)
- RGB screen		  4.3 inch 480x272；5.0 inch 800x480；
- RGB+SPI screen  4.0 inch 480x480(st7701s); 4.0 inch 720x720(nv3052c)
- MIPI screen   	8.0 inch 1280x720(ILI9881C)

We can use following commands to view screen driver information

The following message will be different due to different mirror system

```bash
cat /sys/class/disp/disp/attr/sys

screen 0:
de_rate 300000000 hz, ref_fps:60

```

Test screen color bar ：`echo 1 > /sys/class/disp/disp/attr/colorbar`

#### Play video

Now we can play BadApple On licheeRV [Click me to download video](https://dl.sipeed.com/shareURL/LICHEE/D1/Lichee_RV/MP4)

FFmpeg has been built in Tina image, which is a powerful multimedia library, can be used for screen recording or play video.

Recording command：

```bash
ffmpeg -f fbdev -framerate 10 -i /dev/fb0 record.avi
```

Play commamd (They are play audio from speaker and HDMI)

```
ffmpeg -i /mnt/UDISK/badapple_640480_xvid.mp4 -pix_fmt bgra -f fbdev /dev/fb0 -f alsa hw:0,0  ## speaker
ffmpeg -i /mnt/UDISK/badapple_640480_xvid.mp4 -pix_fmt bgra -f fbdev /dev/fb0 -f alsa hw:2,0  ## hdmi 
```

Because it's decoded by cpu, so the Maximum screen resolution test is 750x540 , and it will run slower if play higher screen resolution.

#### Microphone array(For debian OS only)

Connect board with microphone array (make sure not reverse the cable or not reverse the pin  ), then run `sudo ./micarr_0609` in terminal.

If you need redevelop about microphone array, contact with support@sipeed.com

## 86 Panel

If your device display incorrectly, go to [Questions&Answers](./problems.md) to fix this.

Here we just show simple usage about this board, the usage for [Dock](#use-dock-motherboard) also can be used for 86Panel (Except Light LED by PC0 pins)

For tina os there is no GUI, so we use debian as example.

After finishing burning debian OS, insert mirror card into the board, wait about 2 minutes to see the desktop displays on the screen, during which you can see log form uart port.

![attachmentId-2734](./../../../zh/lichee/assets/RV/LicheeRV_login_picture.png)

Username `sipeed` and Password `licheepi`, use mouse and keyboard to operate it.

![attachmentId-2735](./../../../zh/lichee/assets/RV/desktop_appearance.png)

Then we can de some basic operations.

- Use `Alt+F2` to run "run", then input `termit` to new a terminal command line.

![attachmentId-2736](./../../../zh/lichee/assets/RV/Basic_operation.png)

Let's try to compile and run hello world

![attachmentId-2737](./../../../zh/lichee/assets/RV/Run_HelloWorld.png)

We also provide 720P 720p high-definition screen, you can try this if you have enough money。

When you use this you need to overwrite the board-level configuration to set it in correct configurations to display.[Click here](problems.html#86-panel-screen-no-display-display-wrong) to see more details.

![attachmentId-2738](./../../../zh/lichee/assets/RV/display_1.png)

![attachmentId-2739](./../../../zh/lichee/assets/RV/display_2.png)

### Light LED

Because LED on the core board is reused with the 86Panel motherboard peripheral, We can't light it directly.

After connecting the LED with the reserved IO pad, we can blink it by the same ways how we blink by [dock board](#light-led).

### Connect Internet

#### Connect by Cable

86 Panel supports 100 Megabit networks. And use following commands to connect to Internet after using the network cable included in the package to connect to the subnet port on the board.

```bash
ifconfig eth0 up
udhcpc -ieth0
```

#### Wireless network

You can refer to [Dock wireless network](#wireless-network)

### Others

Same as operating dock motherboard.

#### Touch screen test

<font color=#16B2C>Only tina OS incorporates touch demo</font>

IF you buy 86panel package, just use command `ts_test` to test touch screen

> There is a bug with touch-driver,that is when you remove your finger during test, the cursor stops blink while the terminal still print messages

```bash
root@MaixLinux:/# ts
ts_calibrate  ts_harvest    ts_print_mt   ts_test       ts_verify
ts_finddev    ts_print      ts_print_raw  ts_test_mt    tshowimg
```

## USE BSP SDK

To make it easy for user to develop custom function, Sipeed provide bsp docker image of LicheeRV.

Download link:[Mege netdisk](https://mega.nz/folder/lx4CyZBA#PiFhY7oSVQ3gp2ZZ_AnwYA)

After finishing downloading docker file, decompress into tar file.

```bash
gzip -d licheerv_d1_compile.tar.gz                                #Decompress into tar file
docker import licheerv_d1_compile.tar licheerv_d1_compile:latest  #import docker image
```

After succeed running it's suggessted to relogin and username `nihao` password `sipeed123`

```bash
sudo docker run -it licheerv_d1_compile:latest /bin/bash # Start D1 compile docker image in interactive mode
login # change user
```

You can use following commands to finish compiling.

```bash
cd ~/sdk/tina-d1-open_new/
source build/envsetup.sh
lunch   # choose 1
make menuconfig  # unchoose alsa-plugin, otherwise it fail to compile
# alsa-plugins path in menuconfig
#.
#└── Libraries
#    └── alsa-plugins
make -j8  
pack  
```

There are some new dts file in this SDK, you can use them if necessary
They are in device/config/chips/d1/configs/nezha/board_xxx.dts
