## Supported kernels

Currently T-Heads SDK uses Linux Kernel 5.10: https://gitee.com/thead-yocto
Support is currently added to Linux 6.x, the main contributor of this is `Jisheng Zhang `

## Official Sipeed image

The image for the LicheePi 4A is updated irregularly. The initial image may not be stable, or it may not be able to fully utilize the performance of the TH1520. Please follow the steps below to get the latest image.
The official Sipeed image is based on an adapted Debian.

The default image has two types of account and password configurations, you can try both:
1. User：`root`，`debian`，`sipeed`； the password for all accounts is `licheepi`
2. User: `debian`，password: `debian`； user: `sipeed`，password: `licheepi`

#Burn all partitions
#In the non-boot burning mode, you can enter the command fastboot usb 0 in the uboot command line to burn the partition separately
fastboot flash bootpart bootpart.ext4
fastboot flash boot boot.img
fastboot flash vendor_boot vendor_boot.img
fastboot flash super super.img
fastboot flash userdata userdata.img
fastboot flash vbmeta vbmeta.img
