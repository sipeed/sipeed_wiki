## Product unpacking guide

### Preparation

MaixSense-A010 Uses the serial port protocol to provide interfaces and transmit data.

The physical interfaces we provide include type-c (virtual serial port) and 1.0mm 4pin motherboard (UART), which can obtain depth map data for integration.

**Product wiring instructions**

After connecting to the computer through the type-c interface, it can identify `/dev/ttyUSBx (Linux)` or `COMx (Windows)`.

The usb2ttl module can also be used to connect the 4-PIN bus according to the hardware pin diagram (device screen face down).

### Power-up preview

**Button function**: "Next" on the left and "Switch" on the right.

**Screen display**: the + word in the center of the screen is the ranging point, and the top right will display real-time **xx cm** on behalf of the distance ranging. If there is a large area of objects near the lens, "**block!**" will be displayed on the right of the screen. In other cases **open!**.

After the device is connected to the power supply, you can preview the depth pseudo-color map in real time on the built-in LCD screen of the device.

### PC side preview interaction

Install COMTOOL on the upper computer before previewing and modifying the Settings on the PC.

**Windows system**:[Click to download](https://dl.sipeed.com/shareURL/MaixSense/MaixSense_A010/software_pack/comtool)

**Linux system**:[Users need to compile/click to jump](https://github.com/sipeed/MetaSense-ComTool)

> Note: Windows 7 and below systems need to install the driver, you can go to the FTDI official website to download.

Open the COMTOOL software and select the Graph interface. If there is no Graph above the software, you can add a Graph at the + sign in the upper right corner. If the middle part is blank after creation, double-click MaixSenseLite in the lower left corner

![ms_lcd](./../../../zh/maixsense/maixsense-a010/assets/ms_comtool.jpg)

Select a small Port and baud rate in the left port (choose any high baud rate), click open and check USB to receive a large amount of data. Connected will be displayed in the lower left corner.

![ms_comtool_two](./../../../zh/maixsense/maixsense-a010/assets/ms_comtoolt.jpg)

Set the Header to \x00\xFF to correctly parse the image data and observe the depth map to intuitively feel the depth on the 2D flat image.

### Comtool configuration instructions

Comtool configuration control description of the host computer

- **Header**:et the identification header.
- **RawCMD**:User can send commands manually (USB and UART serial ports behave the same).
- **ISP**:start stop.
- **LCD**:display the lcd screen on and off.
- **USB**:serial port transmission depth map on and off.
- **UART**:serial port transmission depth map on and off.
- **ANTIMMI**:Automatic anti-multi-machine interference is turned on and off (susceptible to interference, the effect of turning off is better)
- **Binn**:pull down to set BINNING, Baud to set UART baud rate.
- **X, Y**:coordinates:When the checkbox to the left of D is on, the (x,y) distance from the camera is displayed.
- **Unit**:sets the quantization unit:16-bit quantization to 8-bit, the scale is reduced, if the setting is too small, only very close images can be seen clearly.
- **FPS**:Set the output frame rate (it should not be too high, set it reasonably according to the performance of the docking device, reducing the frame rate can reduce the amount of transmitted data)
- **Ev**:Exposure gap control (leftmost represents AE, others are fixed exposure time)

## Case:Measure Objects Distance

The distance between the objects is placed to form the difference in depth value. After the module captures the difference, it displays a warm and cold color, a warm color when the distance is close, and a cool color when the distance is far.

## Case:Passengers Flow Statistical 

Real-time, high-precision, high-resolution monitoring of human flow and quickly statistical data.

## Case:Connect to MCUs
- MS-A010 has strong compatibility and is based on serial protocol. It can be connected to single-chip development boards such as K210 bit or linux development boards such as Raspberry Pi for secondary development.
- The k210 Bit development board is a member of the sipeed Maix product line. It is an AIOT development board designed based on the edge intelligent computing chip K210 (RISC-V architecture 64-bit dual-core) of Canaan Canzhi Technology.

## Secondary development:Access ROS

### Access ROS1

**1. Preparations**

First, prepare the applicable environment: `Linux` system.
You can use the virtual machine `virtual box` or `vmware`.

**2. Install and run**

ROS Access Package: [Click to download.](https://dl.sipeed.com/shareURL/MaixSense/MaixSense_A010/software_pack/SDK)

```bash

# Unzip sipeed_tof_ms_a010.zip and enter the directory
cd ros1
source /opt/ros/*/setup.sh
catkin_make
source devel/setup.sh 
rosrun sipeed_tof_ms_a010 a010_publisher _device:="/dev/ttyUSB0"
# After that, the terminal will continue to refresh and display [sipeed_tof]: Publishing, that is, it works normally
```
