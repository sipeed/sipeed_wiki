# INSTALL TD on Linux

## Install TD 

We can download TD install-package and get its license from [Download station](https://dl.sipeed.com/shareURL/TANG).
This may take a really long time to download.
But we need it to development tang primer

IDE File name :  `TD_5.0.3_28716_NL_Linux.zip`
License fileï¼š`Anlogic_20230606.lic`

After finising downloading, new a terminal and cd into where we extract `TD_5.0.3_28716_NL_Linux.zip ` and rename the license file Anlogic_20230606.lic to Anlogic.lic, then move the license file to the TD5.0.28716\license folder in the extract path.

```bash
cd <Application path >
```

The /opt directory is reserved for all software and add-on packages that are not installed by default in Linux system, so we new a dirctionary for TD.

```bash
sudo mkdir /opt/TD_DECEMBER2018
```

Extract TD into /opt/TD_DECEMBER2018 dirctionary

```bash
sudo tar -xvf  TD_5.0.3_28716_NL_Linux.zip -d /opt/TD_DECEMBER2018/
```
