# Tang Nano 9K

>  Edit on 2022.05.13

## Introduction

Tang nano 9K is a development board based on [Gowin](https://www.gowinsemi.com/en/) GW1NR-9 FPGA chip.It equips with HDMI connector, RGB screen interface connector, SPI screen connector, 32Mbit SPI flash and 6 LEDs, so users can use it for FPGA verification, risc-v soft core verification and basic function verification easily and quickly. Its 8640 LUT4 logic units can not only be used for various complex logic circuits designing, but also used for running a complete PicoRV soft core. It also meets various needs of users, such as learning FPGA, verifying soft core and further design.

3. Read this file (in the file downloaded in step 1) : [SUG100-2.6E_Gowin Software User Guide.pdf](https://dl.sipeed.com/fileList/TANG/Nano%209K/6_Chip_Manual/EN/General%20Guide/SUG100-2.6E_Gowin%20Software%20User%20Guide.pdf)

4. Read this [tutorial](./examples/led.md) (LEDs lighting experiment).
   We suggest you recreate a project ang light the led by yourself, this can help you know more about the steps about fpga.
   We recommended you read the following tips during this process:
   - Verilog code specifications (please search by yourself. It is very necessary to obey good code specifications from beginning)
   
	The following documents are very useful for learning FPGA, so we should read them.
	   - SUG949-1.1E_Gowin HDL Coding User Guide.pdf
	   - UG286-1.9.1E_Gowin Clock User Guide.pdf
	The documents mentioned above can be downloaded from our [Download station](https://dl.sipeed.com/shareURL/TANG/Nano%209K/6_Chip_Manual/EN/General%20Guide)
   	And there has been a compressed package contains all documents

   Online tutorial:  
   We suggest two excellent learning sites about verilog : [HDLBITs](https://hdlbits.01xz.net/wiki/Main_Page) and [Verilog Page](https://www.asic-world.com/verilog/index.html)

5. Read this [tutorial](./examples/rgb_screen.md) (5-inch RGB screen Display tutorial). If you can't complete this experiment, you can download our [9K examples](https://github.com/sipeed/TangNano-9K-example) (adapted to 9K + 5-inch screen) to see which step goes wrong.
   **Note: for screen wiring, pay attention to the 1-pin silk screen next to the connector corresponding to 1-pin of the cable**

## Attention

1. If you have trouble with this board, you can join our telegram (t.me/sipeed) or contact us on twitter (https://twitter.com/SipeedIO). Leaving message below is also OK.

2. Visit [Tang questions](https://wiki.sipeed.com/hardware/en/tang/Tang-Nano-Doc/questions.html) first if you have any trouble.
   
3. DO NOT USE JTAG, MODE0/1 and DONE pins. If you really need to use these pins, please refer to [SUG100-2.6E_Gowin Software User Guide.pdf](https://dl.sipeed.com/fileList/TANG/Nano%209K/6_Chip_Manual/EN/General%20Guide/SUG100-2.6E_Gowin%20Software%20User%20Guide.pdf).

4. Please avoid static electricity hitting PCBA; Please release the static electricity from the hand before contacting PCBA.

5. The working voltage of each GPIO has been marked in the schematic . Please do not let the actual working voltage of GPIO exceed the rated value, because it will cause permanent damage to PCBA.

6. When connecting FPC flexible cable, make sure the cable is completely inserted into the base with on offset.

7. Avoid any liquid or metal touching the pads of components on PCBA during working, because this will cause short circuit and damage PCBA.

8. Pay attention to the multiplexed IO. The HDMI io ports are pulled up, when using these ios which are routed to pin headers, then may not meets your command.
