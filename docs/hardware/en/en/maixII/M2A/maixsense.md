# MaixSense

This board is different from Maix-I series, it's main chip not only incorporates AI acceleration hardcore, but also supports running armbian operating systems.

## M2A core board

M2A core board use R329 as main chip, and also contains components like power management chip, fel burn key, wifi module, storge pad reserved and RMGII interface.

### R329 chip

R329 is a 64 bits processor designed by Allwinner containing dual Cortex-A53 inside, with 2 HIFI4 DSP used for audio pre-processing and post-processing, containing an extremely low energy consumption AIPU (Artificial intelligence processing unit) whose hash rate over 0.256 TOPS designed by ARM China, can be used to accelerate neural network, dealing with the 720P image captured by camera.

### MaixSense 

MaixSense is a really small Linux card computer. Its package contains a SOM based on R329, and a multifunction IO expansion bottom board. Running Linux OS, it can be used for personal server, Intelligent voice assistant or robotis. Because of the AIPU npu core, this board can also be used for intelligent voice and video image processing, and AI model like  CV , NLP can also run on it.

**Tina Linux**：Tina Linux is an embedded system built for intelligent hardware products by Allwinner based on openwrt-14.07. Kernel source code, drivers, toolchain, system middleware and application packages can be found @ [https://github.com/sipeed/r329-linux-4.9](https://github.com/sipeed/r329-linux-4.9)

MaixSense not only can run Tina os, but also can run **armbian**, which is built based on debian/ubuntu, is a really full linux os.

| Name | armbian | Tina |
|:---|:---|:---|
|Description| A `Debian OS` for `arm` devices | An OS modified from OpenWRT1404 |
| Feature | Linux mainline, with many advantages | Deeply modified, well fits hardware |
| Target user | New Linux user | Linux developer, custome design  |
