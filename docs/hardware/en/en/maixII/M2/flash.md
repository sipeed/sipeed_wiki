## Get system image file

Download the newest V831 system image from Download website [SDK_MaixII/release](https://dl.sipeed.com/shareURL/MaixII/MaixII-Dock/SDK/release), unpack the downloaded file to get the .img file, which is the system image file. 

> If it slows to download, you can use MEGA: https://mega.nz/folder/5dJSWJDD#nQmiOeJsX6pEl2Q0cBrj2A

## Image name rule

For V831 there is name rule for all files.

Here I take `v831-m2dock-maixhub-0.5.1-20220701.zip` and ` v831-m2dock-maixpy3-0.5.1-20220701.zip`  these two image files for example.

> These images is not the business edition, only can be burned into TF card.

## Buring System on Windows

We use `PhoenixCard` and `PhoenixSuit` to burn image on Windows. The first one is used for burning image file into TF card, and PhoenixSuit is used for burning image file into onboard flash via USB.

Only bussiness edition M2 model contains the Flash, so we need to start the system via TF card on OpenSource edition M2.

- Get [image file](https://dl.sipeed.com/shareURL/MaixII/MaixII-Dock/SDK/release)
- Get SD card Formatter Tool [SD Card Formatter](https://www.sdcard.org/downloads/formatter/eula_windows/SDCardFormatterv5_WinEN.zip)

### Burning system

1. Connect you sd card reader inserted with sd card with your computer, if following information comes out, click `Cancel`
