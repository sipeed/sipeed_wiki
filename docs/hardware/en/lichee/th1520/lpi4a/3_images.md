## Supported kernels

Currently T-Heads SDK uses Linux Kernel 5.10: https://gitee.com/thead-yocto
Support is currently added to Linux 6.x, the main contributor of this is `Jisheng Zhang `

## Official Sipeed image

The image for the LicheePi 4A is updated irregularly. The initial image may not be stable, or it may not be able to fully utilize the performance of the TH1520. Please follow the steps below to get the latest image.
The official Sipeed image is based on an adapted Debian.

There may be problems with the memory identification of some 16G memory core boards, which may cause the system to crash when the memory usage is high.

The default image's account and password configurations is:
User: `debian`，password: `debian`;
User: `sipeed`，password: `licheepi`;
root has no password by default.

### Memory Problem Repair Instructions
IMPORTANT：16GB memory board sendout before 2023.8.1 have a buggy images that can't correctly recognize 16GB memory (occupy errors running big applications), please follow the next instructions to fix this error.

Please use the following command to burn a new u-boot to the board. The u-boot used by 16G memory is in the [Mega Cloud Storage link]( https://mega.nz/folder/phoQlBTZ#cZeQ3qZ__pDvP94PT3_bGA), and can also be downloaded from [this link](https://dl.sipeed.com/shareURL/LICHEE/licheepi4a/07_Tools)
The relevant files are in the `20230803_tempfix.zip` compressed package.
(images of 0721 and later versions can be used normally, no need to replace it with the file here)

```shell
sudo ./fastboot flash ram ./images/u-boot-with-spl-lpi4a-16g.bin
sudo ./fastboot reboot
sleep 1
sudo ./fastboot flash ram ./images/u-boot-with-spl-lpi4a-16g.bin
# If there is no device tree corresponding to 16G ddr in the boot.ext4 you use, you need to burn the boot.ext4 corresponding to 16G ddr
sudo ./fastboot flash boot ./images/boot.ext4
```
