When the system is too idle or the temperature is too high, the frequency will be reduced. Please maintain good heat dissipation to keep the CPU below 60 degrees Celsius for optimal performance. ### Chip temperature `cat /sys/class/thermal/thermal_zone0/temp` The unit is 0.001 degrees Celsius ## UART ### System serial port The system serial port of LicheePi 3A is UART0, which is led out in the side pins. You can use a USB to serial module to connect the serial ports, namely 'U0 RX' and 'U0 TX', paying attention to cross connection and GND connection. ![ttl_link](./assets/peripheral/ttl_link.png) After the connection is completed, you can use the serial port tool for communication. For Windows, XShell and MOBaterm are recommended, and for Linux, Minicom is recommended` Set the serial port baud rate to '115200' to log in and perform command operations under the serial port terminal: > Note: After just connecting, you can press a few Enter keys to check for any response. If there is no response, check the wiring or serial port configuration ![ttl_login](./assets/peripheral/ttl_login.png) ### General serial port The side pins of LicheePi 4A also lead out UART1, which can also be operated. Only UART1 is enabled in the default image, and other serial ports may need to reconfigure device tree operations. #### View serial devices ```bash ls /dev/ttyS* ``` #### Check the baud rate and other information of the serial port ```bash stty F /dev/ttyS1 a ``` #### Set serial port baud rate and data mode ```bash stty F /dev/ttyS1 ispeed 115200 ospeed 115200 cs8 ``` #### View serial port data ```bash cat /dev/ttyS1 ``` #### Send serial port data ```bash echo \"12345\" > /dev/ttyS1 ``` #### Other methods Users can also use 'microcom' or the pyserial library for serial port operations. Please search for relevant information and use it yourself. ## I2C There are multiple I2C devices (I2C0/2/5/6) on LicheePi 3A, with I2C2 connected to a codec chip; I2C5 is connected to the IO expansion chip and also to the pins; I2C6 connects the touch screen and IO expansion chip. Here we use i2c tools for i2c verification operations. The default image does not have i2c tools installed. Please use apt to install them first `apt install i2c tools` List all I2C buses: ```bash root@k1 :~# i2cdetect l i2c 0 i2c spacemit i2c adapter I2C adapter i2c 2 i2c spacemit i2c adapter I2C adapter i2c 5 i2c spacemit i2c adapter I2C adapter i2c 6 i2c spacemit i2c adapter I2C adapter i2c 8 i2c spacemit i2c adapter I2C adapter ``` Detecting devices on the I2C bus, it can be seen that the I2C address of PCA9557PW is 0x18, which is consistent with the schematic diagram: ```bash sipeed@lpi4a :~$ sudo /sbin/i2cdetect r y 5 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 a b c d e f 00: 10: UU 20: 30: 40: 50: 60: 70: ``` In addition, 'i2cdump' can be used to dump all registers at the specified i2c address, 'i2cget' can be used to read the specified register value at the specified i2c address, and 'i2cset' can be used to write the specified register value at the specified i2c address. However, as the IO expansion chip has already been used by the kernel, these commands cannot be directly used for verification. Users can connect external devices to I2C2 for verification. ## SPI LicheePi3A has reserved two SPI paths, one is the SPI Flash pad with empty backside, and the other is the SPI on the pin. Commonly used ioctl commands for SPI: SPI_SOC_maSSAGE: Used for sending and receiving SPI messages, can be used for reading and writing data, controlling devices, and other operations SPI_SOC_2R_MODE: Used to set the working mode of SPI devices, such as CPOL, CPHA, etc SPI_SOC_CD_MODE: Used to read the working mode of SPI devices SPI_SOC WR_LSB_FIRST: Used to set the byte order of SPI devices, that is, whether the highest bit is transmitted first or the lowest bit is transmitted first SPI_SOC_SD_LSB_FIRST: Used to read the byte order of SPI devices SPI_SOC WR_BITs_PER WORD: Used to set the data bit width of SPI devices SPI_SOC RD_BITs_PER WORD: Used to read the data bit width of SPI devices SPI_SOC WR_MAX_SPEED_HZ: Used to set the maximum clock frequency of SPI devices SPI_SOC_SD_MAX_SPEED_HZ: Used to read the maximum clock frequency of SPI devices SPI_SOC WR_MODE32: Used to set the 32 bit mode of SPI devices, such as CPOL, CPHA, etc SPI_SOC_CD_MODE32: Used to read the 32 bit mode of SPI devices The above are some commonly used ioctl commands for SPI devices, which can be used to configure and control various parameters of SPI devices. To turn on/off SPI devices: ```c int open(const char *pathname, int flags); int close(int fd); ``` Header files to be referenced: ```c #include<fcntl.h> #include<unistd.h> ```c #include <stdint.h> #include <unistd.h> #include <stdio.h> #include <stdlib.h> #include <string.h> #include <getopt.h> #include <fcntl.h> #include <sys/ioctl.h> #include <linux/types.h> #include <linux/spi/spidev.h> #define DATA_NUM 2 #define CHECK(ret, str) if (ret < 0) {printf(\"%s\\r\\n\", str); return ret;} static uint8_t bits 8; static uint32_t speed 1000000; // 1M Hz static int mode 0; int main(int argc, char *argv[]) { int ret, fd; fd open(\"/dev/spidev2.0\", O_RDWR); CHECK(fd, \"can't open device\"); mode SPI_MODE_0 SPI_CS_HIGH; ret ioctl(fd, SPI_IOC_WR_MODE32, &mode); CHECK(ret, \"can't set spi mode\"); ret ioctl(fd, SPI_IOC_RD_MODE32, &mode); CHECK(ret, \"can't get spi mode\"); ret ioctl(fd, SPI_IOC_WR_BITS_PER_WORD, &bits); CHECK(ret, \"can't set bits per word\"); ret ioctl(fd, SPI_IOC_RD_BITS_PER_WORD, &bits); CHECK(ret, \"can't get bits per word\"); ret ioctl(fd, SPI_IOC_WR_MAX_SPEED_HZ, &speed); CHECK(ret, \"can't set max speed hz\"); ret ioctl(fd, SPI_IOC_RD_MAX_SPEED_HZ, &speed); CHECK(ret, \"can't get max speed hz\"); printf(\"spi mode: %d\\n\", mode); printf(\"bits per word: %d\\n\", bits); printf(\"max speed: %d Hz (%d KHz)\\n\", speed, speed/1000); uint8_t tx[] {0x11, 0x22}; uint8_t rx[DATA_NUM] {0}; struct spi_ioc_transfer tr { .tx_buf (unsigned long)tx, .rx_buf (unsigned long)rx, .len DATA_NUM, .delay_usecs 0, .speed_hz speed, .bits_per_word bits }; ret ioctl(fd, SPI_IOC_MESSAGE(1), &tr); CHECK(ret, \"can't send spi message\"); printf(\"tx: %.2X %.2X\\r\\n\", tx[0], tx[1]); printf(\"rx: %.2X %.2X\\r\\n\", rx[0], rx[1]); close(fd); return ret; } ``` ## USB LPi3A has 4 USB 3.0 ports, which can be plugged into a USB device to work. It will not be repeated here. Note that if you are using the LPi4A motherboard, the differences in the motherboard may cause the USB A port under the default image to be unusable. For the first use, you need to connect to the serial port or network, enter the device terminal, and replace the dtb Under/boot/spacemit/6.1.15/, overwrite k1 x_lpi3a_4a.dtb with k1 x_lpi3a.dtb and restart to use USB ## ETH LicheePi4A has dual gigabit Ethernet ports, with Eth0 also having PoE functionality. ### PoE The Ethernet 0 interface of LicheePi 4A has PoE function and can be powered through PoE. The PoE power supply module needs to be purchased by oneself, with a specification of 5V voltage and 35.6mm length, which can be obtained by searching for the keyword \"5V PoE pin\". When the visual direction is facing the \"POE POWER\" label, the four pins on the left of the pin are defined from left to right as VA1, VA2, VB1, VB2, and GND, 5VIN on the right. ## Speaker Audio The LicheePi 4A has two analog silicon microphones using ES7210 CODEC, as well as an onboard speaker and stereo headphones using ES8156 CODEC. > Note: The onboard speakers and stereo headphones use a mutually exclusive design. After inserting the headphones, the audio output automatically switches to the headphones, and the onboard speakers become disabled. Easy recording and playback tests can be conducted using APLay and ARECord, please note that the onboard speaker is for the right channel. ```bash #!/ bin/bash echo \"Play Test Audio\" aplay Dhw:1,0 disco48.wav ``` You can also use Alsa related tools, such as' Alsamixer ', to adjust the volume and perform other operations. Please note that currently only 48KHz audio playback is supported. The recording function is currently under development. ## MIPI CSI The LicheePi 3A has two camera interfaces on the back, the 24Pin interface is compatible with the LPi4A's 2 lane camera interface, and the 22Pin interface is compatible with the Raspberry Pi's 22Pin 4 lane camera interface. ## MIPI DSI LicheePi 3A has MIPI DSI0 interface, supports 1080P video output, and can be optionally equipped with a 10.1 inch 1280x800 touch screen. The connection method is shown in the following figure. Both FPC ribbon cables are bottom connected (with the metal contact at the end of the cable facing downwards). When connecting the touch screen adapter board, attention should be paid to the direction. Confirm that the ToLPi4A end is connected to the LPi4A touch ribbon cable, and the ToLcdTP end is connected to the screen: Schematic diagram of metal contact surface of flexible cable: ![fpc](./assets/peripheral/fpc.jpg) Note that before connecting, first pull up the black flip cover on the interface used to fix the cable, confirm that it is connected, and then unplug it. Touch screen ribbon cable connection: ![tpconnector_on_touchscreen](./assets/peripheral/tpconnector_on_touchscreen.jpeg) ![touchconnector_on_board](./assets/peripheral/touchconnector_on_board.jpeg) MIPI screen ribbon cable connection: ![mipi_dsi_connect](./assets/peripheral/mipi_dsi_connect.jpeg) After confirming that the connection is correct, use the firmware (k1 x_lpi3a_lcd. dtb) that supports MIPI screens, and you can see the MIPI screen display upon booting up. ## JTAG The JTAG interface of K1 is multiplexed with TF card signals and can be connected using TF to JTAG small boards. ## GPU The following command can be used to view the real time status of the GPU: ```shell sudo watch cat /sys/kernel/debug/pvr/status ```"},"/hardware/en/lichee/K1/lpi3a/3_burn_image.html":{"title":"Burn Image","content":" title: Burn Image keywords: Linux, Lichee, K1, SBC, RISCV, image update: date: 2024 07 30 version: v1.0 author: zepan content: Release docs ## Get Images ### Bianbu ![bianbu](./assets/image/bianbu.png) LicheePi3A has been supported by the official bianbu image of Spacemit You can go to the official mirror site of Spacemit https://archive.spacemit.com/image/k1/version/bianbu/ ）Download, please note to download images v1.0.11 or higher ### Debian 13 (trixie) ![debian](./../../../../zh/lichee/th1520/lpi4a/assets/images/debian.png) LicheePi3A image from Spacemit Spacemit image: https://archive.spacemit.com/image/k1/version/debian/ ### Fedora ![fedora](./assets/images/fedora.png) https://images.fedoravforce.com/LicheePi%203A ### openKylin ![openKylin](./assets/images/openkylin.png) https://www.openkylin.top/downloads/ ### Deepin ![deepin](./assets/images/deepin.jpg) https://ci.deepin.com/repo/deepin/deepin ports/cdimage/20240815/riscv64/ ### irradium ![irradium](./assets/images/irradium.png) https://dl.irradium.org/irradium/images/lichee_pi_3a/ [mirror 1](https://mirror.serverion.com/irradium/images/lichee_pi_3a/), [mirror 2](https://ftp.cc.uoc.gr/mirrors/linux/irradium/images/lichee_pi_3a/), [mirror 3](https://mirror.accum.se/mirror/irradium.org/images/lichee_pi_3a/) ## Get burning tools LicheePi3A can be burned using fastboot or titan burning tools.

MMF full name is Multimedia Framework, an framework that offers a unified API format for video input/output, audio input/output, image signal processing, and hardware encoding/decoding, allowing users to quickly implement multimedia related functions by calling these APIs. ## Build MMF development environment Please refer to the method introduced in `LicheeRV Nano >System Development >cvi_mmf_sdk` to build the MMF development environment. Or follow the instructions below: ```shell Copy code # Download dependencies sudo apt install pkg config build essential ninja build automake autoconf libtool wget curl git gcc libssl dev bc slib squashfs tools android sdk libsparse utils android sdk ext4 utils jq cmake python3 distutils tclsh scons parallel ssh client tree python3 dev python3 pip device tree compiler libssl dev ssh cpio squashfs tools fakeroot libncurses5 flex bison # Download SDK and toolchain git clone https://github.com/sipeed/LicheeRV Nano Build.git wget https://sophon file.sophon.cn/sophon prod s3/drive/23/03/07/16/host tools.tar.gz tar xvf host tools.tar.gz # Compile all examples with the build_middleware command cd LicheeRV Nano Build git checkout v4.1.0 licheervnano ln s ../host tools ./ source build/cvisetup.sh defconfig cv1812cp_licheerv_nano_sd build_middleware ``` The above instructions describe how to install the MMF related compilation environment and how to compile the MMF examples provided by the SDK. Note: You may fail to compile sample_cvg. If you do not need this example, try again after deleting the `LicheeRV Nano Build/middleware/v2/sample/cvg` folder. If you need this demo, try compiling with `build_all`, which requires compiling the entire SDK, so the compilation time will be longer. ## Development Document Please refer to the `LicheeRV Nano >Board Introduction` to find most of the document. For MMF applications, pay attention to the following document: [Media Processing Software Development Reference](https://doc.sophgo.com/cvitek develop docs/master/docs_latest_release/CV180x_CV181x/en/01.software/MPI/Media_Processing_Software_Development_Reference/build/html/index.html) [SDK LicheeRV Nano Build](https://github.com/sipeed/LicheeRV Nano Build) ## Connecting to the Development Board via Network The purpose of connecting to the development board via network is to upload the firmware we compiled to the board. Please refer to the methods in `LicheeRV Nano >peripheral` to get the IP address of the development board. Any one of the three methods can be implemented: Ethernet connection, WIFI connection, or USB RNDIS connection. ## Compiling and Running an Example MMF will use the hardware directly, so incorrect operation can lead to system crash, and you must be careful to pay attention to details when developing MMF. The suggestion is to modify your own program by using the examples. Compile and run sample_vio example: ```shell # Ensure that the basic MMF compilation environment has been set up and that build_middleware has been compiled once # Compile sample_vio cd middleware/v2/sample/vio make # Upload to the development board (account root, password cvitek) scp sample_vio root@xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx:/root # xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx is the board's IP address # Log into the development board ssh root@xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx # If you need to use the display, you need to run fb_load.sh to make sure the driver is loaded (it only needs to be executed once) /opt/fb_load.sh # Run the example cd ~ ./sample_vio ``` The instructions above explain how to compile a specific MMF example, and how to upload and run the example on the development board. Developers can modify the example based on their applications to eventually develop the functionality they desire. ## Have an unsolvable problem? 1. Please remain patient and carefully review the development document to see if anything was overlooked. For example, check if the input parameters are correct, whether resources have been properly released, etc. 2. Post your problem on [maixhub](https://maixhub.com/discussion) or GitHub. Please organize the functionality you want to achieve, the problems you encountered, the solutions you tried, and the ways to reproduce them, by the way, many times can be solved in the process of organizing your thoughts."},"/hardware/en/lichee/RV_Nano/4_burn_image.html":{"title":"Flashing image","content":" title: Flashing image keywords: riscv, licheerv,nano # Image Format The image is compressed using xz.

UART0 is also brought out on SBU1/2 on the USB interface. You can use the USB TypeC adapter to bring out RX0 and TX0. #### Disable UART0 output log First, transfer the output of the user space to another tty device: ``` #include <stdlib.h> #include <unistd.h> #include <sys/ioctl.h> #include <fcntl.h> int main(int argc, char *argv[]) { int fd; if (argc < 2) { fprintf(stderr, \"usage: %s /dev/ttyX\\n\", argv[0]); exit(EXIT_FAILURE); } fd open(argv[1], O_RDWR); if (fd < 0) { perror(\"open\"); exit(EXIT_FAILURE); } ioctl(fd, TIOCCONS); close(fd); exit(EXIT_SUCCESS); } ``` ``` riscv64 unknown linux gcc tioccons.c o tioccons ./tioccons /dev/tty2 # Transfer /dev/console to tty2 ``` Then set the kernel log level: ``` echo 0 > /proc/sys/kernel/printk ``` Test method: ``` echo userspace > /dev/console echo kernel > /dev/kmsg ``` Another way is to add the following content to /boot/uEnv.txt to switch the console to another tty: ``` consoledev /dev/ttyX ``` ### UART1 UART2 UART3 By default, the pins of UART1 and 2 are used to connect to the UART Bluetooth chip: ``` mmio_write_32(0x03001070, 0x1); // GPIOA 28 UART1 TX mmio_write_32(0x03001074, 0x1); // GPIOA 29 UART1 RX mmio_write_32(0x03001068, 0x4); // GPIOA 18 UART1 CTS mmio_write_32(0x03001064, 0x4); // GPIOA 19 UART1 RTS ``` If you only want to use UART1, you don't need to change PINMUX, just connect GPIOA28 GPIOA29. If you want to use the functions of UART1 and UART2 at the same time, you need to write to the register to set the PINMUX of the pin: In Linux user space, you can use the `devmem` tool to write registers. shell: ``` devmem 0x03001070 32 0x2 # GPIOA 28 UART2 TX devmem 0x03001074 32 0x2 # GPIOA 29 UART2 RX devmem 0x03001068 32 0x6 # GPIOA 18 UART1 RX devmem 0x03001064 32 0x6 # GPIOA 19 UART1 TX ``` The UART3 pins are multiplexed as SDIO by default: ``` mmio_write_32(0x030010D0, 0x0); // D3 mmio_write_32(0x030010D4, 0x0); // D2 mmio_write_32(0x030010D8, 0x0); // D1 mmio_write_32(0x030010DC, 0x0); // D0 mmio_write_32(0x030010E0, 0x0); // CMD mmio_write_32(0x030010E4, 0x0); // CLK ``` If you want to use the UART3 function, you need to write to the register to set the PINMUX of the pin: In Linux user space, you can use the `devmem` tool to write registers. shell: ``` devmem 0x030010D0 32 0x5 # GPIOP 18 UART3 CTS devmem 0x030010D4 32 0x5 # GPIOP 19 UART3 TX devmem 0x030010D8 32 0x5 # GPIOP 20 UART3 RX devmem 0x030010DC 32 0x5 # GPIOP 21 UART3 RTS ``` Serial port usage in Linux system: C: ``` /* TODO */ ``` shell: ``` stty F /dev/ttyS1 115200 # Set the UART1 baud rate to 115200 stty F /dev/ttyS1 raw # Set tty to RAW mode echo n UUU > /dev/ttyS1 # Send UUU(0x55 0x55 0x55) hexdump C /dev/ttyS1 # Display the received data in HEX format ``` ### USB CDC ACM Serial Port When the board's USB Type C port is connected to a computer, it will provide a USB CDC ACM serial port device (provided by Linux gadget). Linux: ``` # Replace /dev/ttyACMX with the specific device, depending on your computer picocom b 9600 /dev/ttyACMX ``` Windows: Press Win + R, enter devmgmt.msc, and press Enter. Find the new device's serial port number under the serial port devices. Then use PuTTY or HyperTerminal to connect. ### USB RNDIS Network Port When the board's USB Type C port is connected to a computer, it will provide a USB RNDIS network card device (provided by Linux gadget). The PC will automatically obtain an address using DHCP. Replace the last digit of the automatically obtained IPv4 address with 1 to get the board's IPv4 address: ``` 10.44.55.66 PC's IPv4 address 10.44.55.1 Board's IPv4 address ``` Then use ssh to connect: `ssh root@board's IP address` Username: root Password: root On Windows system, some configurations need to be made. Open Device Manager and find the following option: ![usb_rndis_step1](./../../../zh/lichee/assets/RV_Nano/peripheral/usb_rndis_step1.png) Select \"Update driver\": ![usb_rndis_step2](./../../../zh/lichee/assets/RV_Nano/peripheral/usb_rndis_step2.png) Select \"Browse my computer for driver software\": ![usb_rndis_step3](./../../../zh/lichee/assets/RV_Nano/peripheral/usb_rndis_step3.png) Select \"Let me pick from a list of available drivers on my computer\": ![usb_rndis_step4](./../../../zh/lichee/assets/RV_Nano/peripheral/usb_rndis_step4.png) In the device type list, select \"Network adapters\": ![usb_rndis_step5](./../../../zh/lichee/assets/RV_Nano/peripheral/usb_rndis_step5.png) For manufacturer, select \"Microsoft\"; for model, select \"Remote NDIS Compatible Device\": ![usb_rndis_step6](./../../../zh/lichee/assets/RV_Nano/peripheral/usb_rndis_step6.png) If this warning pops up, please click \"OK\": ![usb_rndis_step7](./../../../zh/lichee/assets/RV_Nano/peripheral/usb_rndis_step7.png) After the update is successful, it will show as follows: ![usb_rndis_step8](./../../../zh/lichee/assets/RV_Nano/peripheral/usb_rndis_step8.png) Then you can find the \"Remote NDIS Compatible Device\" item under the Network adapters list in Device Manager: ![usb_rndis_step9](./../../../zh/lichee/assets/RV_Nano/peripheral/usb_rndis_step9.png) ### Ethernet Connection Connect the Ethernet cable to the board; the board will automatically obtain an address using DHCP upon boot. The board's image defaults to enabling the MDNS service. Use the command: ``` avahi browse art grep lpirvnano ``` to list devices in the broadcast domain with lpirvnano in their domain names. Then use: ``` ssh root@lpirvnano XXXX.local ``` to connect to the board. ## Disabling the Boot Demo of the Image ``` # Clear rc.local echo '#!/bin/sh' > /etc/rc.local # Reboot reboot ``` ## Audio The LicheeRV Nano supports recording and playback. Standard ALSA tools can be used for recording, playback, and other operations. ### Recording First, set the microphone volume, range: 0 24 ```shell amixer Dhw:0 cset name 'ADC Capture Volume' 24 ``` After setting, start recording: ```shell arecord Dhw:0,0 d 3 r 48000 f S16_LE t wav test.wav & > /dev/null & ``` ### Playback ```shell ./aplay D hw:1,0 f S16_LE test.wav ``` ## I2C I2C1 and I2C3 are brought out on the pin header, and devices can be connected to them. Before using, you need to correctly set the PINMUX: ``` shell# I2C1 devmem 0x030010D0 32 0x2 devmem 0x030010DC 32 0x2 # I2C3 devmem 0x030010E4 32 0x2 devmem 0x030010E0 32 0x2 ``` Then you can use i2c tools to operate the i2c peripherals. The image is already pre installed. ## ADC An ADC route is brought out on the pin header, using ADC1.

The USB C port only supports 5V input. For safety, do not use fast charging power banks or chargers. 2. The IO pins are 1.8V logic level. Please use the shipped serial adapter board or a serial board that supports 1.8V. 3. Computer USB ports usually only provide 5V1A, which is not enough for the board. The board needs at least 5V2A, 5V3A adapter is recommended, or use 12V DC power. 4. If the LED next to the USB silkscreen blinks, it indicates unstable power or a short circuit. Differences between formal and beta hardware versions, USB current limit instructions see[Board hardware overview](https://en.wiki.sipeed.com/hardware/en/lichee/th1520/lpi4a/2_unbox.html#Board hardware overview) ## Images For image versions before 20230721, there is an issue of incorrectly identifying the memory size on the 16+128 core board, the image version needs to be updated. If it is a version after 20230706, you can also refer to[Images summary](https://en.wiki.sipeed.com/hardware/en/lichee/th1520/lpi4a/3_images.html) for repairing. Please read the usage instructions for the image collection in the wiki carefully before using the image, to ensure downloading the expected image, for example using the 10.1 inch touch screen requires flashing the image in the MIPI suffixed compressed package. The Android 13 image currently does not have peripheral support. After flashing, only basic functions like HDMI display are available. ## Burn image When flashing on Windows, please confirm if the driver is installed correctly first. If the driver is installed correctly but there is still no reaction during flashing, try changing the USB cable. Note that the USB cable used must be able to supply power and transmit data, and try not to use the USB ports on the front panel of the PC case when flashing, or the data ports on a laptop, otherwise the device may not be recognized due to power supply issues. To switch boot modes, for example to boot from SD card, formal version boards can switch via dip switches (note a dedicated image is needed), beta version boards can also switch by passing boot arguments, see[Board Boot Process](https://en.wiki.sipeed.com/hardware/en/lichee/th1520/lpi4a/4_burn_image.html#Board Boot Process). After 20231023, large image burning support has been updated. From this version, burning requires using the latest version of fastboot, which can be found in the image collection's [cloud disk link](https://mega.nz/folder/phoQlBTZ#cZeQ3qZ__pDvP94PT3_bGA). The file's name is `burn_tools_support_bigimage.zip`. ## Desktop Usage If the icons in the desktop bottom launcher are not working properly, you can manually configure them as desired, or use the following command to restore the default configuration. See [Web Browser](https://en.wiki.sipeed.com/hardware/en/lichee/th1520/lpi4a/5_desktop.html#Web Browser) for the default configuration. \t```shell \tcp /etc/xdg/xfce4/panel/default.xml /home/sipeed/.config/xfce4/xfconf/xfce perchannel xml/xfce4 panel.xml \tchown sipeed:sipeed /home/sipeed/.config/xfce4/xfconf/xfce perchannel xml/xfce4 panel.xml \t``` If you encounter errors when installing software, please update to the latest image or refer to [Software Source](https://en.wiki.sipeed.com/hardware/en/lichee/th1520/lpi4a/5_desktop.html#Software Installation) for solutions. If you find that the Wifi/BT function of the development board cannot be used or if you cannot see the Wifi device after rebooting, unplug the power supply of the development board, completely disconnect it, and then power it back on to restart. ## Peripheral Use 1. To use the NPU, please use image versions 0920 or later. 2. JTAG requires manual wiring and setting pinmux on the board, refer to [JTAG](https://en.wiki.sipeed.com/hardware/en/lichee/th1520/lpi4a/6_peripheral.html#JTAG). 3. When connecting multiple peripherals (e.g. HDMI, USB keyboard/mouse), use 12V DC power if possible. If the computer's USB port already has many peripherals connected, it may not have enough power for the dev board and connected peripherals. 4. When using the NPU for inference, the first run will optimize on the board, which is a slow process. It will generate a shl.hhb.bm file afterwards. Using this weight file for inference will be much faster. 5. For certain TF cards that do not support UHS and may result in I/O errors when reading or writing large files, you can switch to the root user and execute the following commands: ```shell apt update apt install device tree compiler cd /boot/dtbs/linux image 5.10.113 lpi4a/thead/ # For dual screen, cd /boot/dtbs/linux image 5.10.113 lpi4a/dual/thead/ dtc I dtb O dts light lpi4a.dtb o light lpi4a.dts # For 16GB ddr, change the dt name to light lpi4a 16gb.dtb(light lpi4a 16gb.dts) awk v RS \"}\" '/sd@ffe7090000/ {sub(\"max frequency <0xbcd3d80>;\", \"max frequency <100000000>;\")} {printf \"%s}\", $0}' light lpi4a.dts > temp.dts && mv temp.dts light lpi4a.dts # For 16GB ddr, change the dt name to light lpi4a 16gb.dtb(light lpi4a 16gb.dts) dtc I dts O dtb light lpi4a.dts o light lpi4a.dtb # For 16GB ddr, change the dt name to light lpi4a 16gb.dtb(light lpi4a 16gb.dts) sync ``` After modifying the device tree, restart the development board to apply the changes. 6. If after connecting a Bluetooth mouse, there is no response when moving, you can try restarting the Bluetooth service: ```shell sudo systemctl restart bluetooth.service ``` ## System building ### revyos 1. Before building the kernel/uboot/opensbi, please check if these environment variables are set correctly: \t```shell \texport toolchain_tripe riscv64 unknown linux gnu \texport ARCH riscv \texport nproc 12 \texport GITHUB_WORKSPACE \"~/th1520_build\" \texport PATH \"/opt/Xuantie 900 gcc linux 5.10.4 glibc x86_64 V2.6.1/bin:$PATH\" \t``` \tThe above environment variables need to be adjusted according to your actual configuration, file paths, etc. After building, also check if the corresponding folders are created and paths are correct when installing the files, e.g. `rootfs`, `rootfs/boot` directories. 2. Due to different toolchain versions, binaries built under different SDKs cannot be mixed. 3. If USB and other peripherals stop working after building and flashing, please check if the Image and modules (put module directory to /lib/modules on board) match. ### THead Yocto 1. As of version 1.1.2 of this SDK, changes are needed in the Dockerfile when building the development environment using Docker. See [THead Yocto related section](https://en.wiki.sipeed.com/hardware/en/lichee/th1520/lpi4a/7_develop_thead.html#Build Yocto compilation environment) for the specific changes: \tcomment Dockerfile's line 182 186: \t```shell \t# install npm \t#RUN cd $WORK_PATH \\ \t# && curl fsSL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_lts.x bash \\ \t# && apt install y nodejs yarn \\ \t# && npm install aiot vue cli g \t``` \tthen \t```shell \tdocker build t linux dev base:base . \t``` \t \tAfter installation finished, enter the container and run commands below: \t```shell \tsudo apt update \tsudo apt install npm \tsudo apt install nodejs \t``` \tAt last, run: \t```shell \tnpm v \tnodejs v \t``` \tthere will be output about version info. 3. When using the `MACHINE light lpi4a bitbake thead image linux` command to build the image, if it crashes during the `compile` task, it could be due to insufficient memory. At least 32GB memory is recommended. 4. Due to network issues, download failures or very slow downloads may occur. Using a proxy for downloading is recommended. 5. If you encounter an error like the following: \t```text \tPlease use a locale setting which supports utf 8. \tPython can't change the filesystem locale after loading so we need a utf 8 when python starts or things won't work. \t``` \tPlease follow the steps below: \tFirst, install some dependencies \t```shell \tsudo apt get install locales \tsudo dpkg reconfigure locales \t``` \t Then in the printed list, find the `en_US.UTF8` item (typically around item 158), enter the number corresponding to this item and press enter. Also select this item again and press enter. After the above configuration steps, run the following commands (you can also consider adding the commands below to docker's `.bashrc`): \t```shell \tsudo locale gen en_US.UTF 8 \tsudo update locale LC_ALL en_US.UTF 8 LANG en_US.UTF 8 \texport LANG en_US.UTF 8 \t``` 5. If you encounter an error like the following: \t```text \tplease install them in order to proceed: lz4c pzstd zstd \t``` \tinstall some corresponding dependencies \t```shell \tsudo apt update && sudo apt install y zstd liblz4 tool \t``` ### Android 1. When compiling in a docker environment, you may encounter errors like the following: \t```shell \tBuild sandboxing disabled due to nsjail error. \t``` \tThis error can be ignored for now, it does not affect subsequent build steps. To run nsjail, you can try upgrading the kernel version to 5.XX or passing these parameters when starting docker: ` security opt apparmor unconfined security opt seccomp unconfined security opt systempaths unconfined` or ` privileged`. ## Development Documentation The development documentation can be found at [this link](https://dl.sipeed.com/shareURL/LICHEE/licheepi4a/09_Doc)."},"/hardware/en/lichee/th1520/lpi4a/1_intro.html":{"title":"Board introduction","content":" title: Board introduction keywords: Linux, Lichee, TH1520, SBC, RISCV update: date: 2023 07 21 version: v1.1 author: ztd content: Update English docs date: 2023 05 08 version: v1.0 author: wonder content: Release docs ## Introduction LicheePi 4A is the high performance RISC V linux development board using [Lichee Module 4A](http://wiki.sipeed.com/hardware/en/lichee/th1520/lm4a.html), based on [TH1520](https://www.t head.cn/product/yeying) SOC (4xC910@1.85G, RV64GCV, 4TOPS@int8 NPU, 50GFLOP GPU), LicheePi 4A contains maximum 16GB 64bit LPDDR4X, 128GB eMMC, supports HDMI+MIPI dual 4K display, supports 4K camera input, dual Gigabit Ethernet interfaces (one of these supports POE) amd 4 USB3.0 interfaces, supports kinds of audio processing by C906 core. ![lpi4a](./../../../../zh/lichee/th1520/lpi4a/assets/intro/lpi4a.png) The LicheePi 4A is the most powerful RISC V SBC as of now (Q2 2023). Its performance is about 2 times that of the previous generation RISC V SBC [VisionFive2](https://www.starfivetech.com/en/site/boards). Without enabled custom instruction set acceleration, its performance is close to the Raspberry Pi 4 based on ARM A72. With acceleration enabled, it can match the Raspberry Pi 4. It also has a maximum 16GB ultra large memory, twice that of the Raspberry Pi 4's max 8GB! ![benchmark](./../../../../zh/lichee/th1520/lpi4a/assets/intro/benchmark.png) ![geekbench5](./../../../../zh/lichee/th1520/lpi4a/assets/intro/geekbench5.png) The LicheePi 4A can be used as a typical RISC V verification platform. Its powerful performance allows faster native compilation without the need for QEMU emulation. We will soon (Q2 2023) release the LicheeCluster 4A based on the LM4A for cluster computing, supporting up to 7xLM4A for cluster build and compilation, ideal for distribution build farms. Stay tuned! While maintaining high performance, we have also done our best to design for cost. The 8GB RAM version is priced at ¥749 899 ($100 $130), while the 16GB version is ¥1100 1300 ($155 $185). This is a better price/performance ratio than the Raspberry Pi 4 8GB (~$150)! Whether you are a RISC V enthusiast or not, the LicheePi 4A is a game changing high performance RISC V SBC worth getting! ![desktop](./../../../../zh/lichee/th1520/lpi4a/assets/intro/desktop.png) ## Contributions Welcome This is an online document hosted on GitHub.

Otherwise it might automatically throttle the frequency due to overheating and is unable to deliver the full performance. 1. Installing the thermal pad, take the thermal pad and remove the protective film from both sides, then place the thermal pad in the location shown below, the thermal pad can be re arragnet if needed. Please ensure that you cover the main CPU as well as both memory chips fully. ![silicone_pad](./../../../../zh/lichee/th1520/lpi4a/assets/unbox/silicone_pad.png) 2. Installing the fan / heatsink Align the 30x30mm heatsink and fan with the thermal pad and press down lightly. ![insert_fan](./../../../../zh/lichee/th1520/lpi4a/assets/unbox/insert_fan.png) 3. Connecting the cooling fan By default the cooling fan should already be plugged in when you received the board. If the fan power cables was unplugged, please re plug it as shown in the image below. Pay attention to the polarity of the fan, in case the fan is plugged in backwards it will not work. Note: The fan is controlled by a linux kernel driver which needs to be configured correctly to work. (fan does not spin per default) If you are unsure if the fan works, you can test it by plugging it into a +5V and GND pin on the 20 pin GPIO header. ![insert_fan_cable](./../../../../zh/lichee/th1520/lpi4a/assets/unbox/insert_fan_cable.png) ### WiFi Antenna Installation The WiFi antenna is already connected when you receive the board. If it got unplugged, here is how to install it: ![insert_ant](./../../../../zh/lichee/th1520/lpi4a/assets/unbox/insert_ant.png) ### POE module installation The POE module can be purchased seperatly. It´s a 5V POE power module with a length of 35.6mm, which can be soldered to the POE POWER holes on the development board. The PoE module should be installed like this： <table> <tr> <td><img src \"./../../../../zh/lichee/th1520/lpi4a/assets/unbox/unbox_poe_0.jpg\" alt \"poe_back\"></td> <td><img src \"./../../../../zh/lichee/th1520/lpi4a/assets/unbox/unbox_poe_1.jpg\" alt \"poe_front\"></td> </tr> </table> ### Assembly completed This is what the fully assembled board looks like: ![assemble_ok](./../../../../zh/lichee/th1520/lpi4a/assets/unbox/assemble_ok.png) ## Booting the board LicheePi 4A is pre loaded with a basic system image, so you can try it out directly! Note: The pre loaded system image might be very old. After you booted the system for the first time, please have a look at the next section on how to flash / update the image. Use an HDMI cable (not included) to connect a display (not included) to the HDMI port of LicheePi 4A. Use the supplied USB C cable to connect the board to a USB power supply (not included) with at least 5V and 2A output. The LicheePi 4A will automatically boot into the default image and the login screen should appear within 30 seconds, or automatically login via sipeed username. ![boot_login](./../../../../zh/lichee/th1520/lpi4a/assets/unbox/boot_login.png) The default image's account and password configurations is: User: `debian`，password: `debian`; User: `sipeed`，password: `licheepi`; root has no password by default. If you followed the above procedure, but your display fails to show any image, please check the following: 1. Check whether the USB Power supply is connected correctly, works and whether the power LED is lit on the board. 2. Check that the heatsink is installed correctly and that the fan is spinning. 3. Check that the HDMI connection is correct and that the display is turned on and the correct input is selected. 4. It might be the case that there is no pre loaded image from the factory, in this case check the next section on how to flash an image. 5. If none of the above works, please contact us for support. ## Aluminum Case Installation Guide ### Case Accessory Overview The shell accessories should include the following contents, if there is something missing, please contact customer service. ![20230718_assemble_0](./../../../../zh/lichee/th1520/lpi4a/assets/unbox/20230718_assemble_0.jpg) From left to right: 1. 3507 Turbo Fan 2. 40x40x5mm Aluminum Heat Sink 3.

If you are an enthusiast you can try to overclock the board to 2GHz, but we don´t guarantee that the board will work stable at this frequency. After some testing, about 80% of the boards can boot into the system when overclocked to 2GHz and about 50% of the boards successfully pass the stress test at 2GHz. ### USB Power Limitation The maximum input power of the board is 12V at 2A which is 24W. After it is converted to 5V on the board, there is about 20W of effective power available. In order to provide maximum power to the SOM (the SOM can pull up to 12W when overclocked), the output of the USB Hub is limited to 1.5A. This is for the pre production version of the board, the final version will have a higher current limit based on feedback from the community. When you connect a large number of USB Devices, you might exceed this current limit, in this case we recommend to use an external power supply for the USB devices. If you need to disable the current limit, please do the following: TODO ### Differences between the official version and the beta version 1. Added high voltage protection at the input of the USB C port to prevent some fast charging adapters from burning the SOM due to high voltage input 2. The system serial port IO adds a level conversion IC to 3.3V, which can be connected with a common serial port module 3. Repair the automatic switching circuit of the earphone and speaker (the speaker circuit of the beta version is not in place and unstable) 4. Add a new mic input in the headphone socket 5. Added boot media dial switch (bottom of SOM), optional TF/eMMC boot 6.

At this point, the compilation environment has been configured. ## Machine/Target Support List In the Load Environment Variables step above, you can see the following information after the settings are complete ```bash ### Shell environment set up for builds. ### You can now run 'bitbake <target>' Common targets are: thead image linux thead image multimedia thead image gui machines: light beagle light b product light a val light lpi4a ``` The description is as follows target (list of mirrors supported by the SDK): namingdescription thead image linuxTypical linux system configuration, minimal system plus necessary related basic componentsthead image linux thead image multimediaTypical linux system + video visualization configuration, plus components for the video subsystem (Gstreamer, etc.) thead image gui plus a fully configured version of GUI related components, including Gnome desktop, weston, QT, and other application components, etc. **Currently, the GUI related components compiled with thead image gui option are for functional validation only, and do not have access to a graphical desktop.** machines (board level configuration supported by the SDK): namingdescription light a valTH1520 A EVB board light b productTH1520 B EVB board light beaglebeagleV Ahead board light lpi4aLichee Pi 4A board ## Building an Image The build command format is as follows: ```bash MACHINE {machine} bitbake {target} ``` Replace the {machine} and {target} parts with the corresponding names in the two tables above. For example, the command to compile a typical Linux image running on a LicheePi 4A development board is as follows: ```bash MACHINE light lpi4a bitbake thead image linux ``` ### Problems that may occur when building an image Due to network reasons, this step may still appear download failure or download very slowly, if possible, it is recommended to use a proxy. Error message \t```bash \tPlease use a locale setting which supports utf 8. \tPython can't change the filesystem locale after loading so we need a utf 8 when python starts or things won't work. \t``` \tFirst run the following command \t```bash \tsudo apt get install locales \tsudo dpkg reconfigure locales \t``` \tThen, in the printed list, find the item `en_US.UTF8` (around item 158), enter the serial number of this item, and then enter, and then select this item as well and then enter. \tOnce you've done that, run the following command (you can also add the following command to your docker's `.bashrc`) \t`.bash \tsudo locale gen en_US.UTF 8 \tsudo update locale LC_ALL en_US.UTF 8 LANG en_US.UTF 8 \texport LANG en_US.UTF 8 \t``` \tAfter completing the above steps and compiling again, the original error will not appear. The error message \t```bash \tplease install them in order to proceed: lz4c pzstd zstd \t``` \tJust install the corresponding dependencies \t``bash \tsudo apt update && sudo apt install y zstd liblz4 tool \t``` ### Mirror Packaging The [light_deploy_images](https://gitee.com/thead yocto/light_deploy_images/tree/master/tarball) repository contains a number of pre release images. For freshly compiled images, you can utilize the `sdk.sh` script in this repository to package them. First, switch to the `light fm` directory of the compiled image, and move the `sdk.sh` script from that repository there. Run the script `. /sdk.sh` and the image will be generated, see the [light_deploy_images](https://gitee.com/thead yocto/light_deploy_images/tree/master/) repository for the location of the corresponding files and the structure of the image directory. Finally, you can copy the docker compiled image and associated files to the shared folder that you mounted with the v option, and the host can use the files to burn. At this point, we have finished compiling and packaging the image, and we have an image that can be burned into the development board. **To use the image, you need to manually set a MAC address in uboot using environment variables, with the following commands**. ```shell # 将下列两个地址替换为你的 MAC 地址，eth1addr 的值为ethaddr 的值+1 setenv ethaddr XX:XX:XX:XX:XX:XX setenv eth1addr XX:XX:XX:XX:XX:XX env save ``` A brief introduction to common concepts and some practical tips in yocto. ### Basic concepts Yocto is used to build customized Linux images with a wide range of hardware support, and it is an open source project with a collection of tools. Let's start with a brief introduction to the general workflow of Yocto when building images: Fetch >Extract >Patch >Configure >Build >Install >Package Fetch: Fetch the required source code at compile time. Extract: Extract the fetched source code. Patch: Apply patches to fix bugs and add new features. Configure: configure the development environment. Build: build the image and compile the links. Install: Copy files to the target directory. Package: Package the image. The following figure shows some of the specific steps in the process: ![yocto_flows.png](./../../../../zh/lichee/th1520/lpi4a/assets/develop_thead/yocto_flows.png) The approximate composition of the Yocto project is shown below. The main system used for the build is the OpenEmbedded build system (hereafter referred to as OE), which is centered around the task executor Bitbake. ![yocto_structure](./../../../../zh/lichee/th1520/lpi4a/assets/develop_thead/yocto_structure.png) Some commonly used concepts are as follows: Recipes: Files ending in `.bb`, which contain the information needed to download a package, such as the location of the file from which the fixed source code is downloaded, information about the patches that need to be applied to the package, information about the compilation needs, and so on. For example, `gnome shell` in `xuantie yocto`, its recipes file is stored in `/home/thead/xuantie yocto/meta openembedded/meta gnome/recipes gnome/gnome shell`. directory. build directory: this directory is the output directory of the build, and also stores some environment configuration files. This directory is generated when the `source` command specifies the build environment, and is named `build` by default, but can be changed to other names when `sourcing`, such as `sourece oe init build env mybuild`. configurations: Files ending in `.conf`, mainly configuration files. For example, `local.conf` is stored in the `conf` directory of the `build directory`, and some of its parameters may be changed at compile time as needed. Layers: This is where the various metadata needed (e.g., `.bb` files, `patches` and some other additional files) are usually stored, mainly to tell the OE build system how to build the target files. Categorizing metadata into layers helps with project maintenance. bitbake: a task executor used in the OE build system to perform various tasks. ## Common Operations ### Common Tasks YOcto manages open source software components on a package basis, if you need to compile a certain package, the method is as follows: ```shell bitbake \"package name\" ``` Each package defines supported tasks in the recipes file. Some tasks, such as clean, are common to all packages, and you can list the tasks supported by the package with the following command: ```shell bitbake \"package name\" c listtasks ``` ### Finding the location of a compiled package Yocto integrates with a large number of open source packages, and the working directory where these packages are compiled is usually in the following directory: tmp glibc/work/riscv64 oe linux tmp glibc/work/${MACHINE} For example ```shell thead@b9461db16a58:~/xuantie yocto/thead build/light fm/tmp glibc/work/light_lpi4a oe linux/u boot$ tree L 2 . └── 1_2020.10 r0 ├── 0001 no strip fw_printenv.patch ├── build ├── deploy debs ``` The package directory can be found with the `bitbake e linux thead grep ^S ` command. For example, to see the kernel's build directory ```shell $ bitbake e linux thead grep ^S S \"/home/thead/xuantie yocto/thead build/light fm/tmp glibc/work/light_a_val oe linux/linux thead/5.10.y r0/linux 5.10.y\" ``` The location of the output files after compilation, for example, the various files related to the mirror after compilation are located under `light fm/tmp/glibc/work/light_lpi4a oe linux`, for example, the mirror is located in the `linux thead` of that directory, and only needs to be packaged at the end. ### Slow fetch package at compile time When compiling, may encounter fetch package too slow problem, this is in addition to the use of proxies, you can also download the package to the local, and then according to get the package address to let fetch directly use the local repo. for example: ```shell WARNING: bzip2 native 1.0.8 r0 do_fetch: Failed to fetch URL git://sourceware.org/git/bzip2 tests.git;name bzip2 tests;branch master, attempting MIRRORS if available ``` Then you can find the download address of the package using the following command ```shell $ bitbake e bzip2 grep ^SRC_URI SRC_URI \"https://sourceware.org/pub/bzip2/bzip2 1.0.8.tar.gz git://sourceware.org/git/bzip2 tests.git;name bzip2 tests;branch master file://configure.ac;subdir bzip2 1.0.8 file://Makefile.am;subdir bzip2 1.0.8 file://run ptest \" ``` Once you have the address, manually `clone` the repository and then find its corresponding `.bb` file ```shell $ find name bzip*.bb ./openembedded core/meta/recipes extended/bzip2/bzip2_1.0.8.bb ``` Find the item `SRC_URI` in the file ```shell SRC_URI \"https://sourceware.org/pub/${BPN}/${BPN} ${PV}.tar.gz \\ git://sourceware.org/git/bzip2 tests.git;protocol file;name bzip2 tests;branch master \\ file://configure.ac;subdir ${BP} \\ file://Makefile.am;subdir ${BP} \\ file://run ptest \\ \" ``` Add `protocol` as `file`, and if you need to switch branches, you can just `checkout` to the corresponding branch in the `clone` down local repo, and then directly fetch the package after modifying it. ```shell bitbake bzip2 c fetch ``` If the compilation speed is too slow, find the `local.conf` file in the `conf` directory of `build_directory`, and change the corresponding parameters, refer to [this_doc](https://docs.yoctoproject.org/dev manual/speeding up build. html?highlight bb_numbers), for example, to increase the speed during download and compilation, you can add the following code to the file to increase the number of parallelism (note that it depends on the specific parameters of the CPU) ``` BB_NUMBER_THREADS '16' PARALLEL_MAKE ' j 12' ``` yocto has a caching mechanism for packages after compilation, which can reduce the time spent on compilation later. In addition, you can also download some packages before compiling, put them into a folder, and then find `DL_DIR` in `local.conf` in `conf` folder of `build_directory`, which is a shared folder, and then change it to a specific directory or softlink share. ### Build u boot separately Download the source code to `light fm/tmp glibc/work/light_lpi4a oe linux/u boot/1_2020.10 r0/git` path (the penultimate directory is named version number) at compile time, and execute this command after modifying the source code: ```shell bitbake u boot C compile ``` ### Build opensbi separately Download the source code to `light fm/tmp glibc/work/light_lpi4a oe linux/opensbi/0.9 r0/git` at compile time, and execute this command after modifying the source code: ```shell bitbake opensbi C compile ``` After compilation, to simplify the packing process, a packing script `sdk.sh` is provided in `light_deploy_images`. After compilation, create a `sdk` folder under the `light fm` folder, download the image packaging script to that folder, and run it. A typical directory structure after packaging should look like the following: ```shell . ├── deb │   ├── all │   ├── light_lpi4a │   └── riscv64 ├── images │   └── light lpi4a │   ├── boot.ext4 │   ├── light_fastboot_image_single_rank │   │   └── u boot with spl.bin │   ├── rootfs.thead image linux.ext4 │   └── vmlinux ├── sdk.sh └── tarball └── prebuild_light lpi4a.tar.gz ``` The `images` directory is the main file to use for burning, or you can manually copy in the files if any are missing. The `tarball` directory contains the zip of the packaged image files, and the `deb` directory contains the package.

Once LicheePi 4A is connected to a monitor, you will see the graphical user interface. At the login screen, enter the username sipeed and the password licheepi to log in to the system. > There are three users: root, debian, and sipeed, all with the initial password licheepi. > For some versions, the password for the debian user is sipeed. **Starting from version 0714, the image enables automatic login with the user sipeed.** ![usage_login_userpasserward](./../../../../zh/lichee/th1520/lpi4a/assets/desktop/usage_login_userpasserward.png) ## Open the Command Line In the Debian graphical system on LicheePi 4A, you can directly open the command line terminal using the shortcut `Ctrl` + `Alt` + `T` for quick and convenient system operations. **Starting from version 0714, the image enables passwordless `sudo`** ![usage_debian_terminal_shell_hotkey](./../../../../zh/lichee/th1520/lpi4a/assets/desktop/usage_debian_terminal_shell_hotkey.png) ## Connect to the Network ### Connect to Wired Network LicheePi 4A has two gigabit network interfaces. To connect to a wired network, simply plug in the Ethernet cable into the network interface of LicheePi 4A. <table> <tr> <td>Before connecting the cable</td> <td>After connecting the cable</td> </tr> <tr> <td><img src \"./../../../../zh/lichee/th1520/lpi4a/assets/desktop/usage_debian_ethernet_port_disconnect_one.png\" alt \"usage_debian_ethernet_port_connect_one\"></td> <td><img src \"./../../../../zh/lichee/th1520/lpi4a/assets/desktop/usage_debian_ethernet_port_connect_one.png\" alt \"usage_debian_ethernet_port_connect_one\"></td> </tr> <tr> <td colspan 2> By comparing the two images above, you can see that before connecting the cable, it shows <code>Ethernet Network</code> under <code>disconnected</code>, and after connecting the cable, it shows<code>Wired connection </code></td> </tr> </table> ### Connect to Wireless Network LicheePi 4A has an onboard wireless module that supports Bluetooth and Wi Fi. From the Available networks in the status bar, select the desired wireless network and enter the password to connect automatically. <table> <tr> <td colspan 2><img src \"./../../../../zh/lichee/th1520/lpi4a/assets/desktop/usage_debian_select_wireless_network.png\" alt \"usage_debian_select_wireless_network\"></td> </tr> <tr> <td><img src \"./../../../../zh/lichee/th1520/lpi4a/assets/desktop/usage_debian_wireless_network_password.png\" alt \"usage_debian_wireless_network_password\"></td> <td><img src \"./../../../../zh/lichee/th1520/lpi4a/assets/desktop/usage_debian_wireless_network_connected.png\" alt \"usage_debian_wireless_network_connected\"></td> </tr> </table> In the password input dialog, make sure to select `wlan0` under `Wi Fi adapter` to connect to the network. ## Connect to Bluetooth Devices Find the Bluetooth icon in the top right corner of the desktop. Make sure that the Bluetooth function is enabled. If it's not enabled, right click on the Bluetooth icon to turn it on: ![bluetooth_icon.png](./../../../../zh/lichee/th1520/lpi4a/assets/desktop/bluetooth_icon.png) Once enabled, left click on the Bluetooth icon to access the Bluetooth device scanning interface. Click on the \"Search\" button in the top left corner of this interface to start searching for Bluetooth devices. Make sure the Bluetooth keyboard, mouse, or headphones are in pairing mode so they can be detected. Right click on the desired device and select \"Connect\" to establish the connection. Once connected successfully, you can also right click on the device and click \"Trust\" to enable automatic connection the next time it's detected. ![bluetooth_devices.png](./../../../../zh/lichee/th1520/lpi4a/assets/desktop/bluetooth_devices.png) If you experience the error `br connection profile unavailable` while trying to connect your Bluetooth audio device after pairing the following commands might help. Make sure to execute them under your user and not root: ```shell systemctl user enable pulseaudio systemctl user start pulseaudio sudo apt install bluetooth rfkill blueman bluez bluez tools pulseaudio module bluetooth ``` If the Bluetooth graphic interface fails to detect devices, you can also run `bluetoothctl` in the command line interface to pair devices. Follow these steps: ```shell bluetoothctl scan on # Find the mac address of the desired device pair \"The mac address of the target device\" connect \"The mac address of the target device\" ``` The above steps can also be performed in the Bluetooth graphic interface. However, the graphic interface may have limitations in showing all detected Bluetooth devices. In such cases, you can use the `bluetoothctl` tool first to search and pair the devices. Once the pairing is successful, the device will appear in the graphic interface, and you can switch to the graphic interface for further operations. ## Software Installation After completing the network connection, you can update the software package and install it. ### Software Source On Debian systems, you can use apt (Advanced Packaging Tool) to install software. When installing software, it will search for and download the target software from the system's designated repositories. If the repositories are difficult to access (e.g. the server is too far away or the server network is poor), you can manually edit the repositories to the nearest repository to minimize the download time. By default, the sources are listed in the `/etc/apt/sources.list` file, but you can change it if you need to. You can change this if you need to. However, please note that you need to use sources that support the Risc V architecture. ![usage_debian_apt_change_source](./../../../../zh/lichee/th1520/lpi4a/assets/desktop/usage_debian_apt_change_source.png) ### Upgrading the Software Use `sudo apt update` to update the software list, which is usually needed after changing sources. Before using this command, check the time with the `date` command. If the time is not correct or the time is not updated automatically after connecting to the network, you can update it manually to make sure that the packages in the repository are the latest versions: ```shell sudo date s \"20230717 12:00:00\" ``` Then use `sudo apt upgrade package_name` to update the software with the name `package_name`. For example, the following is an example of using `sudo apt upgrade vim` to update the program `vim`. ![usage_debian_apt_upgrade_vim](./../../../../zh/lichee/th1520/lpi4a/assets/desktop/usage_debian_apt_upgrade_vim.png) If you use the `sudo apt update` command, you encounter a message similar to the following: ```shell Ign:1 https://mirror.iscas.ac.cn/deepin riscv/deepin stage1 beige InRelease Ign:2 https://community packages.deepin.com/driver driver InRelease Ign:3 https://mirror.iscas.ac.cn/deepin riscv/deepin addons beige InRelease Ign:2 https://community packages.deepin.com/driver driver InRelease Ign:1 https://mirror.iscas.ac.cn/deepin riscv/deepin stage1 beige InRelease Ign:3 https://mirror.iscas.ac.cn/deepin riscv/deepin addons beige InRelease Ign:1 https://mirror.iscas.ac.cn/deepin riscv/deepin stage1 beige InRelease Ign:2 https://community packages.deepin.com/driver driver InRelease Ign:3 https://mirror.iscas.ac.cn/deepin riscv/deepin addons beige InRelease Err:2 https://community packages.deepin.com/driver driver InRelease Could not resolve 'community packages.deepin.com' Err:1 https://mirror.iscas.ac.cn/deepin riscv/deepin stage1 beige InRelease Could not resolve 'mirror.iscas.ac.cn' Err:3 https://mirror.iscas.ac.cn/deepin riscv/deepin addons beige InRelease Could not resolve 'mirror.iscas.ac.cn' Reading package lists...

They have been ignored, or old ones used instead. ``` You can try the following command to fix it: ```shell sudo apt get update fix missing ``` ### Installing Programs Software can be installed with the aid of the apt command; for example, `sudo apt install package_name` is used to install `package_name`, and the following is an example of using apt to install `net tools`. ![usage_debian_apt_install_nettools](./../../../../zh/lichee/th1520/lpi4a/assets/desktop/usage_debian_apt_install_nettools.png) After installing `net tools`, you can use the `ifconfig` command. ![usage_debian_ifconfig_result_list](./../../../../zh/lichee/th1520/lpi4a/assets/desktop/usage_debian_ifconfig_result_list.png) The arrow points to what is often referred to as the IP address. If you encounter a message similar to the one below while downloading the software: ```shell W: GPG error: http://archive.ubuntu.com trusty updates Release: The following signatures couldn't be verified because the public key is not available: NO_PUBKEY 40976EAF437D05B5 NO_PUBKEY 3B4FE6ACC0B21F32 ``` You can try the following command to fix it: ```shell sudo apt key adv keyserver keyserver.ubuntu.com recv keys 'Replace the key value after NO_PUBKEY in the error message here' # or gpg keyserver keyserver.ubuntu.com recv keys 'Replace the key value after NO_PUBKEY in the error message here' ``` ## SSH If you don't have the ssh or sshd command in your image, you can install it first with the following command: ```bash sudo apt install ssh openssh server ``` Once installed, you can use ssh to log in remotely to other machines, or use ssh to log in to LicheePi 4A on other machines. You can also use scp to transfer files: ```bash scp demo.zip sipeed@192.168.1.9:~/ `` ## Input Methods If you need to input non ascii characters, you need to install an input method, here is an example of Chinese input method, for other languages, please look for tutorials. First install ibus libpinyin: ```bash sudo apt install y ibus libpinyin ``` > Note that this will consume about 200MB of disk space. After installation, reboot the card and you will see the `IBus Preference` option under Applications, click on it to enter the settings. ![pinyin_cfg0](./../../../../zh/lichee/th1520/lpi4a/assets/desktop/pinyin_cfg0.png) In the interface that appears, click `Input Method`, click `Add`, select `Chinese`, select `Intelligent Pinyin`, and click `Add` to add Chinese Pinyin input method. ![pinyin_cfg1](./../../../../zh/lichee/th1520/lpi4a/assets/desktop/pinyin_cfg1.png) Click on the Input Method icon in the upper right corner to see the following options, select `Chinese Intelligent Pinyin`. ![pinyin_cfg2](./../../../../zh/lichee/th1520/lpi4a/assets/desktop/pinyin_cfg2.png) Now you can enter Chinese into your system without any problem: ![pinyin_cfg3](./../../../../zh/lichee/th1520/lpi4a/assets/desktop/pinyin_cfg3.png) > Note: In the 0425 version of the image, there may be a GPU support issue that causes the GUI to stutter and lag after the input method is installed. ## Office Software Some of the mirrors have the basic Office office software (LibreOffice) built in: ![office0](./../../../../zh/lichee/th1520/lpi4a/assets/desktop/office0.png) LibreOffice Calc is the XLS function: ![office_calc](./../../../../zh/lichee/th1520/lpi4a/assets/desktop/office_calc.png) LibreOffice Impress is the PPT function: ![office_impress](./../../../../zh/lichee/th1520/lpi4a/assets/desktop/office_impress.png) LibreOffice Writer is the WORD function: ![office_writer](./../../../../zh/lichee/th1520/lpi4a/assets/desktop/office_writer.png) ## Web Browser The Chromium browser is built in and is available by clicking the browser icon at the bottom of the desktop: ![browser_location](./../../../../zh/lichee/th1520/lpi4a/assets/desktop/browser_location.png) > If the launch bar icon at the bottom of the desktop is displayed abnormally, you can try to use the following commands to fix it: ```shell cp /etc/xdg/xfce4/panel/default.xml /home/sipeed/.config/xfce4/xfconf/xfce perchannel xml/xfce4 panel.xml chown sipeed:sipeed /home/sipeed/.config/xfce4/xfconf/xfce perchannel xml/xfce4 panel.xml ``` Use a search engine: ![browser_search_engine_use](./../../../../zh/lichee/th1520/lpi4a/assets/desktop/browser_search_engine_use.jpg) Watch online videos: ![browser_play_video](./../../../../zh/lichee/th1520/lpi4a/assets/desktop/browser_play_video.jpg) WebGL support test: ![browser_webgl](./assets/desktop/browser_webgl.png) > Note: In the current 0714 mirror, when playing video or audio under Chromium, there will be noise if it is HDMI audio output, you can switch to Firefox browser to play it temporarily. Use the following commands to install the Firefox browser and related dependencies: ```shell sudo apt install firefox ffmpeg ``` ## Media Player There are some open source players built in the system. The default player is Parole, which supports playing 4K videos. It is recommended to use the hardware accelerated media player Parole as the preferred option. The effect of playing 4K videos with Parole is as follows: ![4k_video_play](./../../../../zh/lichee/th1520/lpi4a/assets/desktop/4k_video_play.png) Also supports kodi, using the effect as follows: ![kodi_homepage](./../../../../zh/lichee/th1520/lpi4a/assets/desktop/kodi_homepage.png) ![kodi_iconmenu](./../../../../zh/lichee/th1520/lpi4a/assets/desktop/kodi_iconmenu.png) ![kodi_settings](./../../../../zh/lichee/th1520/lpi4a/assets/desktop/kodi_settings.png) mpv player supported as well, which can be installed through commands below: ```shell sudo apt update sudo apt install mpv ``` In addition, also preinstalled VLC Player player: ![player](./../../../../zh/lichee/th1520/lpi4a/assets/desktop/player.png) The effect of using VLC Player to view videos in MP4 format is as follows: ![vlc_player_use](./../../../../zh/lichee/th1520/lpi4a/assets/desktop/vlc_player_use.jpg) ## Programming ### Python The python3 environment is built in and can be run directly from the terminal: ![python](./../../../../zh/lichee/th1520/lpi4a/assets/desktop/python.png) If you need to install Python packages, use: `sudo apt install python3 XXX`. For example, to install the pyserial package: `sudo apt install python3 serial`. ### C The `build essential` package is required and takes up about 800MB of disk space. ```bash sudo apt install build essential ``` Then you can compile it with gcc: ![gcc](./../../../../zh/lichee/th1520/lpi4a/assets/desktop/gcc.png) ## Extended Storage The onboard eMMC capacity of the beta version is small, leaving only 2~3GB of space for the user. If you need to carry out mass storage, you need to expand the storage space, and you can choose to use USB storage or TF storage. ### Mounting a USB Flash Drive After inserting a USB flash drive into the USB port of the LicheePi 4A, you can use `dmesg` in the command terminal window to view the hardware change information of the board. The following is the latest information seen in the command line terminal using `dmesg` after connecting the USB flash drive (screenshot). ![usage_debian_udisk_dmesg](./../../../../zh/lichee/th1520/lpi4a/assets/desktop/usage_debian_udisk_dmesg.png) The message above shows the peripheral change information for the board; from this you can see that there is a mass USB storage device connected to the LicheePi 4A. Use the command `cat /proc/partitions grep \"sd*\"` to see the number of partitions within the USB. ![usage_debian_udisk_partition_detail](./../../../../zh/lichee/th1520/lpi4a/assets/desktop/usage_debian_udisk_partition_detail.png) Take the above result as an example, where `sda` refers to the whole USB flash drive, and `sda1` and `sda2` represent the two partitions inside the USB flash drive. First create a folder on the desktop system, and then use the `mount` command to mount a partition of the USB flash disk under the folder. ```bash mkdir ~/Desktop/udisk # Create a folder on your desktop called udisk mount /dev/sda2 ~/Desktop/udisk # Mount the sda2 partition of the USB flash drive to the udisk folder ``` <table> <tr> <td> Before running the command </td> <td> After running the command </td> </tr> <tr> <td style \"white space:nowrap\"><img src \"./../../../../zh/lichee/th1520/lpi4a/assets/desktop/usage_debian_udisk_before_mount.png\" alt \"usage_debian_udisk_before_mount\"></td> <td style \"white space:nowrap\"><img src \"./../../../../zh/lichee/th1520/lpi4a/assets/desktop/usage_debian_udisk_after_mount.png\" alt \"usage_debian_udisk_after_mount\"></td> </tr> <tr> <td colspan 2> After running the command, a new folder named udisk has been added to the desktop, double click the mouse to open the udisk folder and you can see that the contents of the folder are the same as the actual contents of the USB flash drive. <img src \"./../../../../zh/lichee/th1520/lpi4a/assets/desktop/usage_debian_udisk_open_folder.png\" alt \"usage_debian_udisk_open_folder\"></td> </tr> </table> ### Mount TF Card Insert the TF card into the TF slot on the back of the LicheePi 4A and you will see the device `/dev/mmcblk1` under the system (/dev/mmcblk0 is eMMC on the SOM). If the TF card has not been partitioned or formatted, you can use the `sudo fdisk /dev/mmcblk1` command to partition the card. Then use `sudo mkfs.ext4 /dev/mmcblk1p1` or `sudo mkfs.vfat /dev/mmcblk1p1` to format the newly created partition. If you want to use it as an extended partition, it is recommended to use ext4; if you want to use it as a TF card for exchanging data with Windows, it is recommended to use vfat. After formatting, you can mount the partition as in the previous section to make sure it is mounted properly. ### Setting up power on mounting After verifying the success of manual mounting, you can further set up boot mounting. You only need to add the device information that needs to be mounted automatically in /etc/fstab file, the following is an example of adding TF card to be mounted automatically in the last line. ```bash sipeed@lpi4a:~$ cat /etc/fstab # UNCONFIGURED FSTAB FOR BASE SYSTEM /dev/mmcblk0p3 / auto defaults 1 1 /dev/mmcblk0p2 /boot auto defaults 0 0 /dev/mmcblk1p1 /mnt auto defaults 0 2 ``` The first number: 0 means that the disk is not checked at boot, 1 means that the disk is checked at boot; The second number: 0 for the swap partition, 1 for the boot partition (Linux), and 2 for the normal partition. /dev/mmcblk1p1 can also use the disk UUID, which is written as UUID xxxx xxx, and can be viewed using `sudo blkid`: `/dev/mmcblk1p1: UUID \"033173ff b3ab 494c ab14 4dcd656a9214\" BLOCK_SIZE \"4096\" TYPE \"ext4\" PARTUUID \"8e4e28df 01\"` ## VNC Remote Desktop Install the required packages and remote desktop using the lightweight Xfce desktop environment. ```shell sudo apt install xfce4 xfce4 goodies xorg dbus x11 x11 xserver utils sudo apt install tigervnc standalone server tigervnc common ``` After installation, run the `vncserver` command to configure the relevant password. The system will prompt you to configure the password, set it according to your own needs, and the second password is used for view only user login: ```shell sipeed@lpi4a:~$ vncserver You will require a password to access your desktops. Password: Verify: Would you like to enter a view only password (y/n)? n A view only password is not used ``` The associated password is created and stored in a file `~/.vnc`. After the password is set, the following message is displayed ```shell New Xtigervnc server 'lpi4a:1 (sipeed)' on port 5901 for display :1. Use xtigervncviewer SecurityTypes VncAuth passwd /tmp/tigervnc.I5Af7X/passwd :1 to connect to the VNC server. ``` Note that the hostname in the above output is followed by a `:1`, which indicates the display port number of the VNC server. The VNC server will be listening on port `5901`, i.e. 5900+1. Similarly, running the vncserver command to create a second instance will use the next display port `:2`, for which the listening port will be `5902`. Next, kill the VNC instance you just created and do some configuration first. ```shell vncserver kill :1 ``` The xstartup file is a script that runs when the TigerVNC server starts up. Create and edit the file `~/.vnc/xstartup` and write the following: ```shell #!/bin/sh unset SESSION_MANAGER unset DBUS_SESSION_BUS_ADDRESS exec startxfce4 ``` and give permission ```shell chmod +x ~/.vnc/xstartup ``` Next, add the startup parameters for the VNC server. Create and edit the `~/.vnc/config` file and add the required startup parameters. For example, if you want to set the resolution and dpi at startup, you can write the following: ```shell geometry your_prefer_resolution dpi your_prefer_dpi ``` If you cannot connect to VNC because of a firewall, you can use ufw to add allowed ports, for example, using the VNC server's display port 5901: ```shell sudo ufw allow 5901 ``` Finally, it's time to run the vnc server: ```shell vncserver localhost no ``` Next, in order to access the remote host (LPi4A), we need to download and install [vncviewer](https://www.realvnc.com/en/connect/download/viewer/) on the local host (the computer you're using), and once it's installed, start VNCviewer, and on the window At the top, enter the IP address and port number of the remote host (in the format `Your IP address:VNC server's display port number): ![vnc_viewer_connect](./../../../../zh/lichee/th1520/lpi4a/assets/desktop/vnc_viewer_connect.png) By default, the image quality of remote desktop will be set according to the network conditions, low image quality may cause the remote desktop screen color abnormality, at this time, you can manually specify the high image quality. After the first successful connection, right click on the newly appeared session window and select properties: ![vnc_viewer_change_properties](./../../../../zh/lichee/th1520/lpi4a/assets/desktop/vnc_viewer_change_properties.png) Modify the Picture quality in the Options option to High: ![vnc_viewer_settings](./../../../../zh/lichee/th1520/lpi4a/assets/desktop/vnc_viewer_settings.png) The effect displayed is as follows: ![vnc_viewer_use](./../../../../zh/lichee/th1520/lpi4a/assets/desktop/vnc_viewer_use.png) ## btop Btop is an aesthetically pleasing resource that displays processor, memory, disk, network, and process usage and statistics. It can be installed using the following command: ```shell sudo apt install btop ``` Then run the `btop` command on the command line to use it, the effect is as follows: ![btop_use](./../../../../zh/lichee/th1520/lpi4a/assets/application/btop_use.png) ## More Contributions are welcome~ You can get ￥5~150 ($1~20) coupon after your submission is accepted!"},"/hardware/en/lichee/th1520/lpi4a/7_develop_openwrt.html":{"title":"OpenWrt","content":" title: OpenWrt keywords: Linux, Lichee, TH1520, SBC, RISCV, Kernel, SDK, Develop update: date: 2023 09 17 version: v1.1 author: ztd content: Update docs date: 2023 05 12 version: v1.0 author: wonder content: Release docs ## OpenWrt [Project address](https://github.com/ruyisdk/openwrt) ## Build There are some issues with building on Ubuntu currently, using Debian can build smoothly.

The following burning method takes Debian single screen image `LPI4A_20230721.zip`, 16+128 core board as an example. ### Get the burning tool The burning tool can be obtained from the Mega cloud disk and is found in the `burn_tool.zip` file. After decompression the fastboot binary is found in the win/linux/mac subfolders. **Note:** Images from 20231023 and later versions have added support for burning large image files, which require using the latest version of fastboot. You can find the latest version of fastboot in the [cloud disk link](https://mega.nz/folder/phoQlBTZ#cZeQ3qZ__pDvP94PT3_bGA). The file name is `burn_tools_support_bigimage.zip`. ## How to enter burning mode Note that different versions of hardware have slightly different ways to enter the burning mode, see the following chapters. ### Beta Hardware Press and hold the BOOT button on the board while plugging in the USB C cable to power on the board (the other side of the USB C cable should be connected to your PC) This will enter USB burning mode. ![press_boot](./../../../../zh/lichee/th1520/lpi4a/assets/burn_image/press_boot.png) Windows: The board should show up in the Device Manager as “USB download gadget”. Linux: Use `lsusb`, the board should show up in burning mode as `ID 2345:7654 T HEAD USB download gadget` ### Official Hardware / Release Hardware In addition to holding the BOOT button as mentioned above, pay attention to check whether the DIP switch on the bottom board is in EMMC startup mode: ![switch_boot_mode](./../../../../zh/lichee/th1520/lpi4a/assets/burn_image/switch_boot_mode.jpg) After confirming that it is correct, it can be burned, and the next burning steps are the same as the internal test version. ### Windows Driver installation(Disable Driver Signature Checks) The driver needs to be installed manually the first time you use the device. Note that the driver is not digitally signed, and you need to disable the driver signature checks. To disable digital signatures follow the steps below: **Win10** 1. Find the settings of WIN10, click \"Settings\": ![win10_find_windows_settings](./../../../../zh/lichee/th1520/lpi4a/assets/burn_image/win10_find_windows_settings.png) 2. Click the last \"Update and Security\", then click \"Recovery\": ![win10_click_the_restore](./../../../../zh/lichee/th1520/lpi4a/assets/burn_image/win10_click_the_restore.png) 3. After clicking \"Recovery\", click \"Restart\" under Advanced Startup on the right, and the computer will restart at this time. If there are other important programs running, please be careful: ![win10_click_the_restart](./../../../../zh/lichee/th1520/lpi4a/assets/burn_image/win10_click_the_restart.png) **Win11** 1. Find \"System Menu\" in Settings and tap \"Restore\". ![win11_click_the_restore](./../../../../zh/lichee/th1520/lpi4a/assets/burn_image/win11_click_the_restore.png) 2. Click \"Restart\" under Advanced Startup on the right, and the computer will restart at this time. If there are other important programs running, please be careful. ![win11_click_the_restart](./../../../../zh/lichee/th1520/lpi4a/assets/burn_image/win11_click_the_restart.png) **Same Part** 1. After restarting, several options will appear, click on the option \"Troubleshooting\", then click on \"Advanced\", start the settings, and restart. ![click_the_advanced_option](./../../../../zh/lichee/th1520/lpi4a/assets/burn_image/click_the_advanced_option.png) 2. After this will restart, a list will pop up, including options such as safe mode, including the \"prohibit mandatory driver signature\" we care about here, select \"disable mandatory driver signature\", press the corresponding number, and then The computer will restart. ![ban_the_signature](./../../../../zh/lichee/th1520/lpi4a/assets/burn_image/ban_the_signature.png) 3. After restarting, the driver can be installed successfully. If prompted, click to continue the installation. The specific steps of fastboot driver installation are as follows: a. The development board is connected to the computer via usb. b. Open the device manager and the \"USB download gadget\" device will appear. Refer to [Disable Driver signature verification](https://answers.microsoft.com/en us/windows/forum/all/permanent disable driver signature verification/009c3498 bef8 4564 bb52 1d05812506e0#:~:text Start%20your%20computer%20and%20then%20keep%20pressing%20the,your%20keyboard%20to%20select%20Disable%20driver%20signature%20enforcement.) ![before_install_driver](./../../../../zh/lichee/th1520/lpi4a/assets/burn_image/before_install_driver.png) ![install_driver](./../../../../zh/lichee/th1520/lpi4a/assets/burn_image/install_driver.png) ### Windows Driver installation(Manually install signed drivers) This part of tutorial comes from [RevyOS Documentation](https://docs.revyos.dev). Feel free to read it's flash manual when you get into trouble. While holding down the BOOT button on the board, connect the Type C port near the BOOT button to the computer. The board will enter flashing mode. Right click on the Windows logo, open Device Manager. If you see \"USB download gadget\" under \"Other devices\", it means the device has been correctly recognized. However, the driver is not installed. To install the fastboot driver, you need to download the [Google USB Driver (proxy required)](https://dl.google.com/android/repository/usb_driver_r13 windows.zip), download and extract it to a location. 1. Right click on \"USB download gadget\" in Device Manager, click \"Update driver\" 2. Choose \"Browse my computer for drivers\" ![Driver Update Step 2](./assets/burn_image/driver update step 2 en.png) 3. Select \"Let me pick from a list of available drivers on my computer\" 4. Select \"Show All Devices\" and click \"Next\" ![Driver Update Step 4](./assets/burn_image/driver update step 4 en.png) 5. Click \"Have Disk\" 6. Click \"Browse\", select the inf file under the Google USB Driver, click OK ![Driver Update Step 6](./assets/burn_image/driver update step 6 en.png) 7. Select \"Android Bootloader Interface\", click \"Next\", click \"Yes\" in the pop up dialog, click \"Install\" in the Windows Security Center dialog that pops up ![Driver Update Step 7](./assets/burn_image/driver update step 7 en.png) 8. Successfully installed the fastboot driver ![Driver Update Step 8](./assets/burn_image/driver update step 8 en.png) If there are problems with the above steps, please go back to Device Manager, find the device, click \"Uninstall driver\", then unplug and replug the development board and try again. ## Burn the image ### Windows Edit the `burn_lpi4a.bat` decompressed from burn_tool.zip, replace the example image path into your real image path. Then run this `burn_lpi4a.bat` to burn image into LPi4A. Notes: 1. `fastboot.exe` path also needs verifying, otherwise it reports file not found. 2. If you install fastboot driver by manually installing signed drivers shown above, the flash script `burn_lpi4a.bat` may stuck at `< waiting for any device >`. In this case you will see a \"USB download gadget\" under \"Other Devices\", just repeat the driver installation manual and it should be fixed. ![target_burn_image_path](./../../../../zh/lichee/th1520/lpi4a/assets/burn_image/target_burn_image_path.png) ### Linux After putting the board into burning mode, you can use fastboot from `burn_tool.zip` to burn the image. Let´s take linux as an example: Note that you need to mark the fastboot binary as executable first via `chmod +x fastboot` `u boot with spl lpi4a.bin` and `u boot with spl lpi4a 16g.bin` are u boot firmware, please refer to the image description for specific differences. ```bash sudo ./fastboot flash ram ./images/u boot with spl lpi4a 16g.bin sudo ./fastboot reboot sleep 1 sudo ./fastboot flash uboot ./images/u boot with spl lpi4a 16g.bin sudo ./fastboot flash boot ./images/boot_sing.ext4 sudo ./fastboot flash root ./images/rootfs sing.ext4 ``` The first three lines will check and create the partitions on the flash. If you skip this step, burning the rootfs will be very slow later on. `boot sing.ext4` and `boot dual.ext4` for boot For specific differences, please refer to the image description. They mainly include the following: ```bash fw_dynamic.bin #opensbi Image #kernel image kernel release #commit id of kernel light_aon_fpga.bin #fw for E902 aon light_c906_audio.bin #fw for C906 audio light lpi4a.dtb # ddr8G dtb light lpi4a ddr16g.dtb # ddr16G dtb ``` `rootfs sing.ext4` and `rootfs mipi.ext4` are the root file system, and the default is Debian system. For the specific differences between the two, please refer to the image description. Log output you typically see while burning an image: ![burn_image_progress_result](./../../../../zh/lichee/th1520/lpi4a/assets/burn_image/burn_image_progress_result.png) <! ```bash (base) pc@n5105:~/work/$ sudo ./fastboot flash ram u boot with spl.bin Sending 'ram' (935 KB) OKAY [ 0.248s] Writing 'ram' OKAY [ 0.002s] Finished.

Total time: 281.671s ``` > ## Board Boot Process brom > U Boot SPL > U Boot > OpenSBI > Kernel Here is a brief overview of each stage and sample console output. The board now has a level shifter for the serial port to 3.3V logic, so a regular USB serial adapter can be used. ### brom Typical output: ```shell brom_ver 8 [APP][E] protocol_connect failed, exit. ``` The brom stage loads initial code from the SoC's ROM and looks for the next stage bootloader. ### U Boot SPL Typical output: ```shell U Boot SPL 2020.01 gd6c9182f (Jul 07 2023 12:31:51 +0200) FM[1] lpddr4x dualrank freq 3733 64bit dbi_off n sdram init ddr initialized, jump to uboot image has no header ``` U Boot SPL stands for Secondary Program Loader. It initializes RAM, loads the main U Boot into RAM and jumps to it. ### U Boot Typical output: ```shell U Boot 2020.01 gd6c9182f (Jul 07 2023 12:31:51 +0200) CPU: rv64imafdcvsu Model: T HEAD c910 light DRAM: 8 GiB C910 CPU FREQ: 750MHz AHB2_CPUSYS_HCLK FREQ: 250MHz AHB3_CPUSYS_PCLK FREQ: 125MHz PERISYS_AHB_HCLK FREQ: 250MHz PERISYS_APB_PCLK FREQ: 62MHz GMAC PLL POSTDIV FREQ: 1000MHZ DPU0 PLL POSTDIV FREQ: 1188MHZ DPU1 PLL POSTDIV FREQ: 1188MHZ MMC: sdhci@ffe7080000: 0, sd@ffe7090000: 1 Loading Environment from MMC...

Typical environment variable configuration: Set MAC addresses: ```shell setenv ethaddr ae:be:2a:50:5e:89 setenv eth1addr ae:be:2a:50:5e:8a saveenv ``` Just replace the MAC address in the above command with your own MAC address. Note that the value of `eth1addr` is the value of `ethaddr` plus 1. Set kernel device tree: ```shell setenv fdt_file light lpi4a.dtb saveenv ``` Replace `light lpi4a.dtb` in the above command with the file name of the desired device tree stored in `boot.ext4`. After the setting is complete, you can also use the `printenv` command to check whether it is correct, and then enter the `boot` command to enter the kernel. In addition, you can also set startup parameters here to choose a startup method, such as using an SD card to start. After burning the image to the SD card, insert the SD card into the development board and enter U Boot: ```shell env set f set_bootargs 'setenv bootargs console ttyS0,115200 root /dev/mmcblk1 rootfstype ext4 rootwait rw earlycon clk_ignore_unused loglevel 7 eth ethaddr rootrwoptions rw,noatime rootrwreset {factory_reset} init /lib/systemd/systemd' env save ``` After the above steps are completed, enter the `reset` command to restart the development board, and the system can be booted from the SD card. For the official version of the development board, you can use the DIP switch on the bottom board to select the startup mode: ![switch_boot_mode](./../../../../zh/lichee/th1520/lpi4a/assets/burn_image/switch_boot_mode.jpg) ### OpenSBI Some initialization prints in OpenSBI's sbi_init.c file will not be displayed in the startup log, but you can see some information about OpenSBI being printed out when the Kernel starts: ```shell [ 0.000000] SBI specification v0.3 detected [ 0.000000] SBI implementation ID 0x1 Version 0x9 [ 0.000000] SBI v0.2 TIME extension detected [ 0.000000] SBI v0.2 IPI extension detected [ 0.000000] SBI v0.2 RFENCE extension detected [ 0.000000] SBI v0.2 HSM extension detected ``` OpenSBI has three kinds of firmware, the one used here is FW_DYNAMIC, which will load the next stage according to the information passed in the previous stage. The fw_dynamic.bin firmware of OpenSBI is stored in boot.ext4, which will boot the kernel at this stage. ### Kernel A typical log of this stage is as follows (because it is too long, only part of it is intercepted): ```shell [ 0.000000] Linux version 5.10.113 g387b6863253c dirty [ 0.000000] OF: fdt: Ignoring memory range 0x0 0x200000 [ 0.000000] earlycon: uart0 at MMIO32 0x000000ffe7014000 (options '115200n8') [ 0.000000] printk: bootconsole [uart0] enabled [ 0.000000] efi: UEFI not found.

Thanks to llama.cpp, an excellent project, we can run LLM on LicheePi 4A. Zepan slightly modified llama.cpp [https://github.com/Zepan/llama.cpp](https://github.com/Zepan/llama.cpp) earlier to allow it to run the 7B model with less memory (down to about 700MB). You can see that TH1520 takes about 6s to compute a token (without V extension acceleration, which is expected to accelerate it by a factor of 4 8, so feel free to pitch in if you've added V extension support!) ![llama_th1520](. /... /... /... /... /zh/lichee/th1520/lpi4a/assets/application/llama_th1520.png) The feasibility of running the 7B model on an entry level C906 core was also briefly tested, and due to the small amount of memory in the D1 and the use of mmap read only extensions, a large number of low speed IO operations were introduced, which slowed down the speed of the run, ending up at only 18s/token. ![llama_d1](./../../../../zh/lichee/th1520/lpi4a/assets/application/llama_d1.png) ## YOLOX Target Detection This tutorial is an example of how to deploy the [YOLOX](https://github.com/Megvii BaseDetection/YOLOX) model to accomplish target detection on the LPi4A (LicheePi 4A) development board platform(CPU inference). Included in the tutorial: Installing the Python environment on the LPi4A development board Executing the model using the source code from the YOLOX project. The tutorial follows the usual model deployment process: 1. Basic Python environment configuration on LPi4A. 2. 2. Obtaining the yolox source code and models 3. Installing python packages that yolox depends on 4. Example execution using HHB onnxruntime on LPi4A **Basic Python Environment Configuration** **Basic Hardware and Software Configuration** Refer to the description in LPi4A's \"[Out of the box experience](https://wiki.sipeed.com/hardware/zh/lichee/th1520/lpi4a/2_unbox.html)\", install the development board correctly, and enter with root privileges after powering on and booting up. Ensure that you are connected to the Internet, and update the apt source. ```bash sudo apt update ``` Install some software for subsequent use in the example ```bash sudo apt install wget git vim ``` Installing the SHL Library ```bash wget https://github.com/T head Semi/csi nn2/releases/download/v2.4 beta.1/c920.tar.gz tar xf c920.tar.gz cp c920/lib/* /usr/lib/riscv64 linux gnu/ rf ``` **Python Environment Configuration** Python version 3.11 is installed by default on the system where LPi4A is burned. You can confirm this with the following command ```bash python version ``` We will use python 3.11 as an example, but for other versions, you will need to change to the corresponding version of the command when installing dependencies. Most of the packages that the various python programs depend on can be installed via pip, which can be installed with the following command ```bash apt install python3 pip ``` Before installing other python packages, install the venv package, which is used to create a python virtual environment ```bash apt install python3.11 venv ``` Create a python virtual environment and activate it ```bash cd /root python3 m venv ort source /root/ort/bin/activate ``` At this point, the basic python environment has been created. Similar to other architectures, you can install pure python packages directly via pip install. The opencv installation will depend on other python packages, so if pip does not download them automatically, you can install the dependencies manually first. See [download riscv whl](https://www.yuque.com/za4k4z/uzn618/zsp0krgg9dlp0fhx) for more information on how to get the packages. **Get YOLOX** [YOLOX](https://github.com/Megvii BaseDetection/YOLOX) is a YOLO like target detection model with quite excellent performance. The source code and model can be downloaded directly from github ```bash git clone https://github.com/Megvii BaseDetection/YOLOX.git cd YOLOX/demo/ONNXRuntime wget https://github.com/Megvii BaseDetection/YOLOX/releases/download/0.1.1rc0/yolox_s.onnx ``` **Modify the source code** This tutorial will use the HHB onnxruntime execution model, so switch to. In the onnxruntime example directory in the source code, modify the beginning of the file demo/ONNXRuntime/onnx_inference.py to add two new lines of code ```bash #!/usr/bin/env python3 # Copyright (c) Megvii, Inc. and its affiliates. +import sys +sys.path.insert(0, \"../../\") + import argparse import os ``` The code uses sys.path.insert to specify the search path, thus eliminating the need to install the YOLOX installer from the source code. **Installing dependencies The python ecosystem for the RISC V architecture is still lacking, but in the future, packages dependent on YOLOX can be installed directly from the [requirements.txt](https://github.com/Megvii BaseDetection/YOLOX/blob/main/) file. requirements.txt) file. The YOLOX example in this tutorial relies on a large number of python packages, download the pre compiled python packages ```bash git clone b python3.11 https://github.com/zhangwm pt/prebuilt_whl.git cd prebuilt_whl ``` It can be handled manually in the following order. ```bash pip install numpy 1.25.0 cp311 cp311 linux_riscv64.whl pip install opencv_python 4.5.4+4cd224d cp311 cp311 linux_riscv64.whl pip install kiwisolver 1.4.4 cp311 cp311 linux_riscv64.whl pip install Pillow 9.5.0 cp311 cp311 linux_riscv64.whl pip install matplotlib 3.7.2.dev0+gb3bd929cf0.d20230630 cp311 cp311 linux_riscv64.whl pip install pycocotools 2.0.6 cp311 cp311 linux_riscv64.whl pip3 install loguru 0.7.0 py3 none any.whl pip3 install torch 2.0.0a0+gitc263bd4 cp311 cp311 linux_riscv64.whl pip3 install MarkupSafe 2.1.3 cp311 cp311 linux_riscv64.whl pip3 install torchvision 0.15.1a0 cp311 cp311 linux_riscv64.whl pip3 install psutil 5.9.5 cp311 abi3 linux_riscv64.whl pip3 install tqdm 4.65.0 py3 none any.whl pip3 install tabulate 0.9.0 py3 none any.whl ``` The installation process will involve other pure python dependencies, which pip will automatically download from the official sources. **Installation of HHB onnxruntime** HHB onnxuruntime is a port of the SHL backend (execution providers) that allows onnxruntime to reuse the high performance optimized code in SHL for the Gentei CPU. ```bash wget https://github.com/zhangwm pt/onnxruntime/releases/download/riscv_whl/onnxruntime 1.14.1 cp311 cp311 linux_riscv64.whl pip install onnxruntime 1.14.1 cp311 cp311 linux_riscv64.whl ``` **Execute** Execute the onnx_inference.py example in the example directory ```bash python3 onnx_inference.py m yolox_s.onnx i soccer.jpg o outdir s 0.3 input_shape 640,640 ``` `python3 onnx_inference.py m yolox_s.onnx i soccer.jpg o outdir s 0.3 input_shape640,640` Parameter Description: m: specify model i: specify image o: specify output directory s: specify the detection threshold input_shape: specify the size of the image to be used for detection **Reference results** The input for this tutorial is the following image, which is an image of an athlete playing soccer, and the expected detection result is to detect two people and a soccer ball. > Image from the web ![yolox_detection_soccer_input.jpg](./../../../../zh/lichee/th1520/lpi4a/assets/application/yolox_detection_soccer_input.jpg) After the example executes normally, the result image soccer.jpg will be generated in the outdir directory. the image will draw the detected target with a box and labeled with the probability, and the effect is as shown in the following figure: ![yolox_detection_soccer_output.jpg](./../../../../zh/lichee/th1520/lpi4a/assets/application/yolox_detection_soccer_output.jpg) ## MobilenetV2 This tutorial is an example of how to deploy the mobilenetv2 model for image classification on the LicheePi4A platform. The tutorial includes: Compiling the onnx model into a binary available on LicheePi4A using HHB Preprocessing the mobilenetv2 model using opencv c++ version on LicheePi4A Differences between using CPU and NPU on LicheePi4A ### NPU #### Setup After setting up the NPU environment according to the [peripheral](https://wiki.sipeed.com/hardware/zh/lichee/th1520/lpi4a/6_peripheral.html#NPU) documentation, we can go to the Docker image of HHB environment. First, we need to get the model of this tutorial, which is downloaded to the example directory `/home/example/th1520_npu/onnx_mobilenetv2_c++`: [mobilenetv2 12.onnx](https://github.com/onnx/models/blob/main/vision/classification/mobilenet/model/mobilenetv2 12.onnx) To get the libraries for the optimized version of opencv used in this tutorial, go to [github](https://xuantie.t head.cn/community/download?id 4112956065753141248) and download them to the directory `/home/example/th1520_npu/`. ```shell cd /home/example/th1520_npu/ git clone https://github.com/zhangwm pt/prebuilt_opencv.git ``` #### Compile **HHB Compiling Model:** To cross compile the ONNX model into an executable program on the NPU, you need to use the hhb command. Note that the NPU only supports 8 bit or 16 bit fixed point operations, which in this case are int8 asymmetric quantization. To compile, you need to go to the directory `/home/example/th1520_npu/onnx_mobilenetv2_c++`: ```shell cd /home/example/th1520_npu/onnx_mobilenetv2_c++ hhb D model file mobilenetv2 12.onnx data scale 0.017 data mean \"124 117 104\" board th1520 postprocess save_and_top5 input name \"input\" output name \"output\" input shape \"1 3 224 224\" calibrate dataset persian_cat.jpg quantization scheme \"int8_asym\" ``` The options are: D: Specifies that the HHB process will run until the executable is generated model file: Specifies the mobilenet model that has been downloaded in the current directory data mean: Specifies the mean value data scale: Specifies the scale value board: Specifies that the target platform is th1520 input name: The input name of the model output name: The output name of the model input shape: The input size of the model postprocess: Saves the output results and prints the top5 results calibrate dataset: Specifies the calibration images required for quantization quantization scheme: Specifies the quantization scheme as int8 asymmetric After the command is executed, the hhb_out subdirectory will be generated in the current directory, which includes hhb_runtime, model.c and other files: hhb. bm: The HHB model file, including the quantized weight data and other information hhb_runtime: The executable on the th1520 platform, compiled from the c file in the directory main. c: A temporary file, the reference entry of the sample program model. c: A temporary file, the model structure file, related to the model structure model.params: A temporary file, the weight values io. c: A temporary file, the auxiliary functions for reading and writing files io. h: A temporary file, the auxiliary functions for reading and writing files declaration process. c: A temporary file, the image preprocessing function process. h: A temporary file, the image preprocessing function declaration For more detailed HHB options, refer to the command line options in the [HHBUserManual](https://www.yuque.com/za4k4z/kvkcoh/shl1nybhel6iviwt). **g++ Compiling** ```shell riscv64 unknown linux gnu g++ main.cpp I../prebuilt_opencv/include/opencv4 L../prebuilt_opencv/lib lopencv_imgproc lopencv_imgcodecs L../prebuilt_opencv/lib/opencv4/3rdparty/ llibjpeg turbo llibwebp llibpng llibtiff llibopenjp2 lopencv_core ldl lpthread lrt lzlib lcsi_cv latomic static o mobilenetv2_example ``` The mobilenetv2_example file is generated in the example directory after the compilation command is executed correctly. #### Execute After the cross compilation is complete, you can copy the files needed for program execution to the directory of the development board. The scp command can be used: ```shell scp r ../onnx_mobilenetv2_c++ sipeed@your_ip:~ ``` First confirm whether the driver in the development board is loaded: ```shell lsmod ``` If there are 'img_mem', 'vha' and 'vha_info' in the output of the three modules, the NPU driver is loaded successfully.

The model used in this tutorial is from the google bert repository and has been converted to the onnx version of the BERT model, which can be downloaded to the `/home/example/c920/bert_small` directory with the following command: ```shell cd home/example/c920/bert_small wget https://github.com/zhangwm pt/bert/releases/download/onnx/bert_small_int32_input.onnx ``` #### Compile **HHB Compile** To cross compile the ONNX model into an executable program on the NPU, you need to use the hhb command. Note that only 8 bit or 16 bit fixed point operations are supported on the NPU, which is defined as int8 asymmetric quantization in this example. To compile, you need to first go to the directory where the sample is located `/home/example/c920/bert_small` : ```shell cd /home/example/c920/bert_small hhb model file bert_small_int32_input.onnx input name \"input_ids;input_mask;segment_ids\" input shape '1 384;1 384;1 384' output name \"output_start_logits;output_end_logits\" board c920 quantization scheme \"float16\" postprocess save_and_top5 D without preprocess ``` The options are: D: Specifies that the HHB process will run until the executable is generated model file: Specifies that the bert model has been downloaded in the current directory data mean: Specifies the mean value data scale: Specifies the scale value board: Specifies that the target platform is th1520 input name: The input name of the model output name: The output name of the model input shape: The input size of the model postprocess: Saves the output results and prints the top 5 results calibrate dataset: Specifies the calibration images required for quantization quantization scheme: Specifies that the quantization scheme is int8 asymmetric After the command is executed, the hhb_out subdirectory will be generated in the current directory, which includes hhb_runtime, model.c and other files: hhb. bm: The HHB model file, including the quantized weight data and other information hhb_runtime: The executable on the th1520 platform, compiled from the c file in the directory main. c: A temporary file, the reference entry of the sample program model. c: A temporary file, the model structure file, related to the model structure model.params: A temporary file, the weight values io. c: A temporary file, the auxiliary functions for reading and writing files io. h: A temporary file, the auxiliary functions for reading and writing files declaration process. c: A temporary file, the image preprocessing function process. h: A temporary file, the image preprocessing function declaration For more detailed HHB options, refer to the command line options in the [HHBUserManual](https://www.yuque.com/za4k4z/kvkcoh/shl1nybhel6iviwt). After the compilation command is executed correctly, an executable file is generated in the example directory. You can copy the example directory to the development board and run it. ```shell scp r ../bert_small sipeed@your_ip:~ ``` #### Excute The preceding steps to execute the example program are the same as YOLOv5n, which will not be described here. After the preceding steps are correct, you can run commands in the example directory ```shell python3 inference.py ``` #### Results The reference input in this example comes from the SQuAD dataset, a reading comprehension dataset consisting of questions posed by a set of Wikipedia articles, where the answer to each question is a piece of text from the corresponding reading article or question. The input for this example is as follows. The article describes the game of a rugby game and asks the question of who participated in the game. ``` [Context]: Super Bowl 50 was an American football game to determine the champion of the National Football League (NFL) for the 2015 season. The American Football Conference (AFC) champion Denver Broncos defeated the National Football Conference (NFC) champion Carolina Panthers 24–10 to earn their third Super Bowl title. The game was played on February 7, 2016, at Levi's Stadium in the San Francisco Bay Area at Santa Clara, California. As this was the 50th Super Bowl, the league emphasized the \"golden anniversary\" with various gold themed initiatives, as well as temporarily suspending the tradition of naming each Super Bowl game with Roman numerals (under which the game would have been known as \"Super Bowl L\"), so that the logo could prominently feature the Arabic numerals 50.

If you don't add them, you'll need to execute Docker related commands with sudo privileges every time you execute them. Next, let's pull up the hello world image to get a taste of Docker: ```shell sipeed@lpi4a:~$ docker pull hello world Using default tag: latest latest: Pulling from library/hello world b102dd09f2b3: Pull complete Digest: sha256:926fac19d22aa2d60f1a276b66a20eb765fbeea2db5dbdaafeb456ad8ce81598 Status: Downloaded newer image for hello world:latest docker.io/library/hello world:latest ``` Next, start the container you just pulled off: ```shell sipeed@lpi4a:~$ docker run hello world Hello from Docker! This message shows that your installation appears to be working correctly. To generate this message, Docker took the following steps: 1. The Docker client contacted the Docker daemon. 2. The Docker daemon pulled the \"hello world\" image from the Docker Hub. (amd64) 3. The Docker daemon created a new container from that image which runs the executable that produces the output you are currently reading. 4. The Docker daemon streamed that output to the Docker client, which sent it to your terminal. To try something more ambitious, you can run an Ubuntu container with: $ docker run it ubuntu bash Share images, automate workflows, and more with a free Docker ID: https://hub.docker.com/ For more examples and ideas, visit: https://docs.docker.com/get started/ ``` View information about the hello world mirror: ```shell sipeed@lpi4a:~$ docker images hello world REPOSITORY TAG IMAGE ID CREATED SIZE hello world latest eb6f80695a28 2 months ago 4.98kB ``` To experience a more complete image, go [here](https://hub.docker.com/) and search for the name of the distribution you want to use and pull it. ## K3s RISCV This chapter will show how to run the lightweight Kubernetes distribution K3s on LPi4A. First download the precompiled K3s package: https://github.com/CARV ICS FORTH/k3s/releases Then merge the downloaded packages into a `.gz` file and decompress it. After completion, add execution permission to k3s: ```shell wget https://github.com/CARV ICS FORTH/k3s/releases/download/20230721/k3s riscv64.gz.aa wget https://github.com/CARV ICS FORTH/k3s/releases/download/20230721/k3s riscv64.gz.ab wget https://github.com/CARV ICS FORTH/k3s/releases/download/20230721/k3s riscv64.gz.ac # The following commands need root user to execute sudo i cat k3s riscv64.gz.* gunzip > /usr/local/bin/k3s chmod +x /usr/local/bin/k3s exit ``` Verify whether it can run successfully. The typical output of a successful run is as follows: ```shell sipeed@lpi4a:~$ k3s NAME: k3s riscv64 Kubernetes, but small and simple USAGE: k3s riscv64 [global options] command [command options] [arguments...] VERSION: v1.27.3+k3s 9d376dfb dirty (9d376dfb) COMMANDS: server Run management server agent Run node agent kubectl Run kubectl crictl Run crictl ctr Run ctr check config Run config check token Manage bootstrap tokens etcd snapshot secrets encrypt Control secrets encryption and keys rotation certificate Manage K3s certificates completion Install shell completion script help, h Shows a list of commands or help for one command GLOBAL OPTIONS: debug (logging) Turn on debug logs [$K3S_DEBUG] data dir value, d value (data) Folder to hold state (default: /var/lib/r) help, h show help version, v print the version ``` Now, download and run the k3s install script: ```shell curl sfL https://get.k3s.io > k3s install.sh chmod +x k3s install.sh INSTALL_K3S_EXEC \"server disable metrics server\" INSTALL_K3S_SKIP_DOWNLOAD \"true\" bash x ./k3s install.sh ``` After running, use the following command to check whether k3s is running normally. Typical output is as follows: ```shell sipeed@lpi4a:~$ systemctl status k3s ● k3s.service Lightweight Kubernetes Loaded: loaded (8;;file://lpi4a/etc/systemd/system/k3s.service/etc/systemd) Active: active (running) since Mon 2023 07 31 06:48:34 UTC; 6s ago Docs: 8;;https://k3s.iohttps://k3s.io8;; Process: 3240 ExecStartPre /bin/sh xc ! /usr/bin/systemctl is enabled qu> Process: 3242 ExecStartPre /sbin/modprobe br_netfilter (code exited, status> Process: 3243 ExecStartPre /sbin/modprobe overlay (code exited, status 0/SU> Main PID: 3244 (k3s server) Tasks: 37 Memory: 529.5M CPU: 54.841s CGroup: /system.slice/k3s.service ├─3244 \"/usr/local/bin/k3s server\" └─3361 \"containerd ``` Next, we create a new configuration file to run the k3s container: ```shell vi hello lpi4a.yaml ``` The content of the file is as follows (refer to https://raw.githubusercontent.com/CARV ICS FORTH/kubernetes riscv64/main/examples/hello kubernetes.yaml): ```yaml apiVersion: v1 kind: Service metadata: name: hello spec: type: ClusterIP ports: port: 8080 selector: app: hello apiVersion: apps/v1 kind: Deployment metadata: name: hello spec: replicas: 1 selector: matchLabels: app: hello template: metadata: labels: app: hello spec: containers: name: hello kubernetes image: carvicsforth/hello kubernetes:1.10.1 env: name: MESSAGE value: \"Hello Lichee Pi 4A!\" ``` Then start a container with this configuration file. A typical input is as follows: ```shell sipeed@lpi4a:~$ sudo kubectl apply f hello lpi4a.yaml service/hello created deployment.apps/hello created ``` Then check the status of pods (if the IP address is not displayed in the output, you can wait a little longer and check again): ```shell sipeed@lpi4a:~$ NAME READY STATUS RESTARTS AGE IP NODE NOMINATED NODE READINESS GATES hello 5b576d45d7 fdjgh 1/1 Running 0 16m 10.42.0.6 lpi4a <none> <none> ``` Next, use curl to test whether the k3s container runs successfully. The typical output is as follows: ```shell sipeed@lpi4a:~$ curl 10.42.0.6:8080 <!DOCTYPE html> <html> <head> <title>Hello Kubernetes!</title> <link rel \"stylesheet\" type \"text/css\" href \"/css/main.css\"> <link rel \"stylesheet\" href \"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family Ubuntu:300\"> </head> <body> <div class \"main\"> <img src \"/images/kubernetes.png\"/> <div class \"content\"> <div id \"message\"> Hello Lichee Pi 4A! </div> <div id \"info\"> <table> <tr> <th>namespace:</th> <td> </td> </tr> <tr> <th>pod:</th> <td>hello 5b576d45d7 fdjgh</td> </tr> <tr> <th>node:</th> <td> (Linux 5.10.113 gfac22a756532)</td> </tr> </table> </div> <div id \"footer\"> paulbouwer/hello kubernetes:1.10.1 (linux/riscv64) </div> </div> </div> </body> </html> ``` So far, the k3s container has run successfully. The page shows as follows: ![k3s_hello_world](./../../../../zh/lichee/th1520/lpi4a/assets/application/k3s_hello_world.png) ## Minecraft Server Here we take `1.20.1` version as an example, LPi4A as Server and PC (Ubuntu 22.04) as Client. First download the Fizzed optimized nitro JDK 19 from [here](https://github.com/fizzed/nitro/releases/tag/builds), extract it, rename the folder and move it to the `/opt/` directory: ```shell tar xvf fizzed19.36 jdk19.0.1 linux_riscv64.tar.gz sudo mv fizzed19.36 jdk19.0.1 linux_riscv64 /opt/jdk_19 ``` Test if this JDK is available: ```shell sipeed@lpi4a:~$ /opt/jdk_19/bin/java version openjdk version \"19.0.1\" 2022 09 20 OpenJDK Runtime Environment Fizzed19.36 (build 19.0.1+10) OpenJDK 64 Bit Server VM Fizzed19.36 (build 19.0.1+10, mixed mode) ``` If the version number appears, it is available. If you have already pre installed a different version of the JDK, you can change the softlinks by checking the original softlinks and making a note of them so that you can change them back later: ```shell sipeed@lpi4a:~$ ls /usr/bin/java l lrwxrwxrwx 1 root root 22 Apr 26 10:40 /usr/bin/java > /etc/alternatives/java ``` Then change the softlink to point to the JDK you just installed: ```shell sudo rm /usr/bin/java sudo ln s /opt/jdk_19/bin/java /usr/bin/java ``` Verify that the soft link was configured successfully with the command ```shell java version ``` If the version appears, the configuration was successful. Next, download the original server side jar file to LPi4A at [here](https://www.minecraft.net/zh hans/download), noting that the version is ``1.20.1``, and then execute it on LPi4A first: ```shell java jar server.jar nogui ``` If prompted ```shell [ServerMain/WARN]: Failed to load eula.txt [ServerMain/INF0]:You need to agree to the EULA in order to run the server. Go to e ula.txt for more info. Go to eula.txt for more info. Changes false to true on the corresponding line in the `eula.txt` file in the current directory: ```shell eula true ``` Save and exit, restart the server, the first startup will be slower, be patient, the startup time will be displayed after the startup is complete (the following time is not the first startup time): ```shell [03:51:02] [Server thread/INFO]: Time elapsed: 36394 ms [03:51:02] [Server thread/INFO]: Done (52.927s)! For help, type \"help\" ``` Next, you can connect after launching the client on the PC, we recommend using the third party client launcher HMCL (download link https://hmcl.huangyuhui.net/download/). Once the download is complete, launch HMCL: ```shell java jar HMCL 3.5.5.jar ``` You can download ``1.20.1`` version directly in the launcher and configure the game account, then you can enter the game, after entering the game, enter the server IP (LPi4A's IP) to add the server to connect (make sure that the computer and LPi4A are under the same network), the effect is as follows: ![mc_server_menu](./../../../../zh/lichee/th1520/lpi4a/assets/application/mc_server_menu.png) ![mc_server_use](./../../../../zh/lichee/th1520/lpi4a/assets/application/mc_server_use.png) > Note that if you want to change back to the original version of the JDK, run: > ```shell. > sudo rm /usr/bin/java > sudo ln s /opt/jdk_19/bin/java /etc/alternatives/java > ``` ## Wine CE First download [here](https://gitee.com/wine ce/wine ce/releases/tag/v8.9) the `wine ce_dlls_8.9.0.all.tar.xz`, `wine ce_core_8.9.0.riscv64.tar.xz` files. Both files are assumed to be downloaded to the user's home directory (the latest version is 8.9 at the time of writing this document).

It can also be experienced on LPi4A by compiling the source code: First install dependencies: ```shell sudo apt get install build essential cmake libbluetooth dev libsdl2 dev \\ libcurl4 openssl dev libenet dev libfreetype6 dev libharfbuzz dev \\ libjpeg dev libogg dev libopenal dev libpng dev \\ libssl dev libvorbis dev libmbedtls dev pkg config zlib1g dev ``` Next, refer to [documentation](https://github.com/supertuxkart/stk code/blob/master/INSTALL.md#building supertuxkart on linux) step to compile: ```shell # clone and configure src git clone https://github.com/supertuxkart/stk code stk code svn co https://svn.code.sf.net/p/supertuxkart/code/stk assets stk assets # go into the stk code directory cd stk code # create and enter the cmake_build directory mkdir cmake_build cd cmake_build # run cmake to generate the makefile cmake .. DBUILD_RECORDER off DNO_SHADERC on #compile make j$(nproc) ``` After compiling, you can find the `supertuxkart` program in the `bin/` folder in the current directory. Just run: ```shell ./bin/supertuxkart ``` The effect is as follows: ![supertuxkart_play](./../../../../zh/lichee/th1520/lpi4a/assets/application/supertuxkart_play.png) ## llama2.c [project_link](https://github.com/karpathy/llama2.c) We can run a small model of Llama 2 by following the steps in the project link documentation. First, clone the project and switch to the changed project directory: ```shell git clone https://github.com/karpathy/llama2.c.git ``` Then download the model.bin file and place it in the specified directory: ```shell wget https://karpathy.ai/llama2c/model.bin P out ``` Then compile and run: ```shell gcc O3 o run run.c lm ./run out/model.bin ``` You can get the following output: ```text <s> Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She loved to play with her dolls and teddy bea rs. One day, she saw her friend Lucy playing with her favorite doll. Lily: \"Lucy, can I play with you?\" Lucy: \"Sure, but can you be careful with my doll?\" Lily: \"Sure, I promise I won't break her.\" Lucy: \"That's very original. I really love it.\" Lily smiled and showed her doll to her mom. Her mom said, \"That's nice, Lily. Let's put your doll on the shelf and play with her some more.\" From that day on, Lily and her doll played together every day. They were the best of friends and didn 't break anyone's possession. <s> Once upon a time, there was a little boy named Timmy. Timmy loved to eat sandwiches. One day, Timmy' s mom made him a sandwich for lunch. It was so yummy and tasty! But then, something unexpected happen ed. Timmy's little sister spilled some juice on his sandwich.

It was a key! He was very surprised. He took the key and ran home. He showed his mom the key. Tom's mom said the key was for a sneeze. The sneeze was a sneeze. Tom's mom put the key next to her p ocket. Tom said, \"Now you can have a sneeze too!\" Tom put his nose under his ears. He went home and took a nap. When he woke up, he had a small sneeze from the key. It was not food or water. Tom was happy and laughed. <s> Once upon a time, there was a bunny. The bunny was very restless and wanted to explore, so he hopped off his little house. The bunny hopped and hopped until he saw a shiny silver carrot. He was so excited to eat it, he achieved tok/s: 52.043098 ``` ### Stable Diffusion [OnnxStream](https://github.com/vitoplantamura/OnnxStream) This example runs Stable Diffusion on LPi4A with this project. First, we need to build the XNNPACK: ```shell git clone https://github.com/google/XNNPACK.git cd XNNPACK git checkout 3f56c91b492c93676a9b5ca4dd51f528b704c309 mkdir build cd build cmake DXNNPACK_BUILD_TESTS OFF DXNNPACK_BUILD_BENCHMARKS OFF .. cmake build . config Release ``` Next, build the Stable Diffusion example: ```shell git clone https://github.com/vitoplantamura/OnnxStream.git cd OnnxStream cd src mkdir build cd build cmake DXNNPACK_DIR <此处替换为clone的XNNPACK存放路径> .. cmake build . config Release ``` Now we have the runnable Stable Diffusion example file ``sd``, run with the following parameters: ```shell . /sd models path . rpi ``` Where ` models path` is the model file downloaded from the project's Release page, which can be placed in the directory where the `sd` file is located. The runtime configuration is as follows: ```shell [start] positive_prompt: a photo of an astronaut riding a horse on mars negative_prompt: ugly, blurry output_png_path: . /result.png steps: 10 ``` The result is the `result.png` file, and the image from the above prompt is as follows: ![onnxstream_result](./../../../../zh/lichee/th1520/lpi4a/assets/application/onnxstream_result.png) ## PSP Simulator [Project address](https://github.com/hrydgard/ppsspp) This example runs the PSP simulator on LPi4A through this project.

Note that the kernel image and kernel module directories must correspond to each other, or else the peripheral functions will be disabled due to the missing kernel module. Starting from commit `c56347a43e850de287a2249d3d9118910718527b`, the kernel defaults to include a 16GB memory device tree, so 8G/16G share one kernel, with only uboot being different. ## Building uboot Note that at this point, you are still in the th1520_build directory and have already configured the environment variables and toolchain, refer to building the kernel for the steps. ```shell git clone https://github.com/revyos/thead u boot.git uboot ``` Note that at this point, you are still in the th1520_build directory and have already configured the environment variables and toolchain, refer to building the kernel for the steps. ```shell pushd uboot # Build uboot for 16G memory version make light_lpi4a_16g_defconfig make CROSS_COMPILE ${toolchain_tripe} ARCH ${ARCH} j$(nproc) find . name \"u boot with spl.bin\" xargs I{} cp av {} ${GITHUB_WORKSPACE}/rootfs/u boot with spl lpi4a 16g.bin make clean # Build uboot for 8G memory version make light_lpi4a_defconfig make CROSS_COMPILE ${toolchain_tripe} ARCH ${ARCH} j$(nproc) find . name \"u boot with spl.bin\" xargs I{} cp av {} ${GITHUB_WORKSPACE}/rootfs/u boot with spl lpi4a.bin make clean popd ``` When flashing, pay attention to flash the uboot corresponding to the development board you are using. When flashing, please pay attention to the command you use. If the image version you are using is `0912` or above, you only need to run the following command to upgrade uboot: ```shell sudo ./fastboot flash uboot u boot with spl lpi4a 16g.bin ``` Check the output files ```shell tree ${GITHUB_WORKSPACE}/rootfs ``` ## Build opensbi Note that at this point, you are still in the th1520_build directory and have already configured the environment variables and toolchain, refer to building the kernel for the steps. ```shell git clone https://github.com/revyos/thead opensbi.git opensbi ``` Then start executing the compile command ```shell pushd opensbi make PLATFORM generic ARCH ${ARCH} CROSS_COMPILE ${toolchain_tripe} sudo install D p m 644 build/platform/generic/firmware/fw_dynamic.bin \\ \"${GITHUB_WORKSPACE}/rootfs/boot/\" popd ``` Checking the output files ```shell tree ${GITHUB_WORKSPACE}/rootfs ``` Pack the kernel, uboot, opensbi related files from the current build into a zip archive. ```shell tar zcvf kernel.tar.gz rootfs ``` To use the build files, just replace the files in the zip package to the appropriate locations. Delete the files to be replaced in boot.ext4, then the files under rootfs/boot/ are put into boot.ext4; Replace rootfs/lib/modules/ with the /lib/modules/ directory in rootfs.ext4; If you have built perf, replace the files under rootfs/sbin with the files under /sbin in rootfs.ext4; Just burn uboot directly. ## GStreamer Player Adaptation Documentation with PTG omxil Library Support ### Overview PTG's OpenMAX IL library (hereinafter referred to as vpu omxil) enables the LicheePi 4A to smoothly hard decode 4k 60fps video, so how to use this library? This article will mainly introduce the integration and use of the Parole player on the LicheePi 4A development board, users can follow this article to understand the process of adapting to the LicheePi 4A Take the hard decoding of h264 as an example, the workflow of the hard decoding of the video is shown in the following figure ```text + + + + + + + + + + + + video stream + > omxh264dec + > video sink + + > player + + + + + + + GStreamer + + + GStreamer +++ ++ ++ + v + vpu omxil + + + vpu omxil +++ vpu omxil +++ vpu omxil + v + kernel module (driver) + + + kernel module (driver) +++ v hardware ``` 1. the video stream is read in by the GStreamer and then goes through a series of pre processing before being sent to the GStreamer's decoder `omxh264dec`. 2. omxh264dec calls a dynamic library, the vpu omxil library provided by PTG, which accesses the hardware (kernel module) through the driver to perform hard decoding. 3. the decoded stream is transferred to the video sink of GStreamer and rendered by the player ### GStreamer omxh264dec decoding test The omxh264 decoding section is separated out and has the following general structure ```text + + + + + + + + + omxh264dec + + GStreamer + + + omxh264dec + + v + + + + vpu omxil vpu omxil + + libomxil bellagio + + + libomxil bellagio + v + memalloc vc8000 hantrodec vidmem kernel modules + + + kernel modules +++ v kernel modules +++ v ``` We build the chain shown in bottom up order. The main purpose of this section is to get the omxh264dec decoder up and running, and does not deal with outputting screens, etc. The main purpose of this section is to get the omxh264dec decoder running. #### 1. Driver Compilation, Installation, and Hardware Access Setup Hard decoding requires access to the hardware, and access to the hardware requires a driver, so you need to compile and install the driver. ##### 1.1 Compile driver PTG provides the driver source: https://gitee.com/thead yocto/vpu vc8000e kernel https://gitee.com/thead yocto/vpu vc8000d kernel https://gitee.com/thead yocto/video_memory ##### 1.2 Install the driver ```shell # depmod analyzes the dependencies of loadable modules and adds a modules.dep file to /lib/modules/<kernel version> for subsequent modprobe use sudo depmod a sudo modprobe vidmem vc8000 hantrodec memalloc ## If you are having trouble installing modprobe, try using insmod to install it. #cd /usr/lib/modules/$(uname r) #sudo insmod $(find . name *vidmem.ko*) #sudo insmod $(find . name *vc8000.ko*) #sudo insmod $(find . name *hantrodec.ko*) #sudo insmod $(find . name *memalloc.ko*) # Optional: set bootloader module echo e \"\\nvidmem\\nhantrodec\\nmemalloc\\nvc8000\\n\" sudo tee a /etc/modules > /dev/null ``` ##### 1.3 Setting Hardware Access Privileges After installing the kernel module, three device files, hantrodec vidmem vc8000, appear in the /dev directory. By default, users do not have access rights to these files. If you do not change the permissions, non root users will get an error when opening the omxil library. ```shell # Execute the shell once. cd /dev sudo chmod 666 hantrodec vidmem vc8000 # Long term cat << EOF sudo tee /lib/udev/rules.d/70 hantro.rules > /dev/null KERNEL \"vidmem\", MODE \"0666\" KERNEL \"hantrodec\", MODE \"0666\" KERNEL \"vc8000\", MODE \"0666\" EOF ``` ##### RevyOS Adaptation Records To get the kernel module for a specific version of RevyOS, go to [revyos/thead kernel](https://github.com/revyos/revyos/wiki/%E6%94%AF%E6%8C%81 PTG omxil %E5%BA%93%E7%9A% 84 GStreamer %E6%92%AD%E6%94%BE%E5%99%A8%E9%80%82%E9%85%8D%E6%96%87%E6%A1%A3), and download the artifacts from the GitHub CI #### 2. Install vpu omxil and adjust the configuration First, download and extract vpu omxil into /usr/lib/omxil/: [vpu omxil_1.2.1.tar.gz](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1pYgCVI7WltfpskltJ RqzVUCEC21FS56/ edit?pli 1). As shown below, it is required: 1. register the OpenMax component from vpu omxil to libomxil bellagio 2. gst omx (this package provides the omxh264dec decoder) You also need to know the name of the component you are calling when you call libomxil bellagio. ```text + + + + + + gst omx + > libomxil bellagio + > vpu omxil + + + + + + ``` ##### 2.1 Registering components from vpu omxil to libomxil bellagio ```shell sudo apt install libomxil bellagio bin libomxil bellagio0 # Register the component omxregister bellagio v /usr/lib/omxil/ ``` ##### 2.2 Adjusting gstomx.conf settings Adjust the settings of gstomx.conf so that the decoder omxh264dec calls the correct components, see the patch for gst omx: [gst omx 01 add libomxil config.patch](https://gist.github.com/Sakura286/26777ea8204c1819885e093806a4f7ca#file gst omx 01 add libomxil config patch) #### 3. Add dmabuf patch Please check the dmabuf patch for gst omx provided by PTG: [gst omx 02 set dec out port dmabuf.patch](https://gist.github.com/Sakura286/26777ea8204c1819885e093806a4f7ca#file gst omx 02 set dec out port dmabuf patch) #### 4. GStreamer decoding preliminary test ```shell sudo apt install gstreamer1.0 omx generic gstreamer1.0 omx bellagio config gstreamer1.0 plugins bad gstreamer1.0 plugins base gstreamer1.0 gl gstreamer1.0 plugins good gstreamer1.0 tools # 1 Basic decoding gst launch 1.0 filesrc location <test.mp4> ! qtdemux ! h264parse ! omxh264dec ! videoconvert ! fakesink sync false # 2 Display fps in terminal # Reference: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/73948308 gst launch 1.0 filesrc location <test.mp4> ! qtdemux ! h264parse ! omxh264dec ! videoconvert ! fpsdisplaysink video sink fakesink text overlay false sync false v 2>&1 ``` `fakesink` swallows the previous video stream in its entirety and doesn't output the picture (thus not losing performance in the video sink part), but in combination with fpsdisplaysink you can read the decoding speed. The normal log is as follows: ```shell Setting pipeline to PAUSED ... [DBGT] vc8kdec compiled without trace support (ENABLE_DBGT_TRACE switch not enabled) Pipeline is PREROLLING ... Redistribute latency... OMX ! decoder_get_parameter OMX_ErrorNoMore (2) Pipeline is PREROLLED ... Setting pipeline to PLAYING ... New clock: GstSystemClockRedistribute latency... 0:01:39.5 / 0:01:49.4 (90.9 %) ``` **[TIP]** If there is [omxh264dec omxh264dec0: Could not initialize supporting library.](https://gist.github.com/Sakura286/ 015fae6792e160268db7ad8a697dd2df), you can install `gst omx`, `libomxil bellagio` and `debug symbol` package related to `libc6`, and start the above commands with `gdb` for debugging. When debugging, break `DWLInit` and then break `open`, depending on which part of `open` is wrong. ##### RevyOS adaptation log During the adaptation of RevyOS, the following three reasons were found for the failure of initializing dynamic libraries: 1. the toolchain used to compile vpu omxil is not compatible with the current system 2. vpu omxil was not registered with `omxregister bellagio`. 3. not adjusting permissions on devices like `hantrodec`, `vc8000`, `vidmem` in `/dev` directory. ### B. Selecting a suitable GStreamer video sink The `video sink` is the last step of the video stream in the whole [GStreamer pipeline](https://gstreamer.freedesktop.org/documentation/tutorials/basic/concepts.html), and its role is generally to output the video stream to the screen. The `fakesink` in the previous section is just a special `video sink` to test that the decoder is working correctly, [optional video sink](https://gstreamer.freedesktop.org/documentation/tutorials/basic/platform) specific elements.html?gi language c) are very numerous, common ones are `autovideosink`, `ximagesink`, `xvimagesink`, `fbdevsink`, `waylandsink`, `glimagesink`, `gtkglsink` and so on. gtkglsink`, etc. They are each in different plugin packages and need to be installed as appropriate: **video sink** **Package name** waylandsink gtkglsink waylandsink gtkglsink waylandsink gstreamer1.0 plugins bad fbdevsink gstreamer1.0 plugins bad autovideosink gstreamer1.0 plugins good gtkglsink fbdevsink gstreamer1.0 plugins bad gtkglsink gstreamer1.0 plugins good gstreamer1.0 plugins good gstreamer1.0 plugins good ximagesink \\ xvimagesink gstreamer1.0 plugins base glimagesink gstreamer1.0 plugins base \\ gstreamer1.0 gl **[TIP]** Use `gst inspect 1.0 <video sink name>` to see what options are available for the corresponding video sink. **[TIP]** Add ` gst debug level <lv>` to get more [output logs] (https://gstreamer.freedesktop.org/documentation/tutorials/basic/debugging tools. html#the debug log), where `<lv>` stands for 1 to 6, and the verbosity level is from low to high, it is recommended to be at level 4 and below, otherwise the log will be very long. Please try different video sinks, and try different plugin parameters, and different environment variables, until you find one that can smoothly harden H264. #### RevyOS adaptation log `**waylandsink**`: Since RevyOS now (20230720) uses the Xfce desktop, it is not possible to support Wayland, so `waylandsink` does not work in principle. `**fbdevsink**` and `**ximagesink**`: not working `**xvimagesink**`: via [pipeline graphs](https://gstreamer.freedesktop.org/documentation/tutorials/basic/debugging tools.html#getting pipeline graphs) and logs, we can determine that playbin or autovideosink will automatically call xvimagesink, and after analyzing with perf, we can find that using xvimagesink will inevitably perform a large number of memcpy operations, which will seriously degrade the decoding performance; this problem still exists after obtaining PTG's dmabuf patch. This problem still exists after obtaining PTG's dmabuf patch, so it is not possible to use `**gtkglsink**`: [GTK3 does not support EGL on X11](https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/gtk/ /issues/738), and RevyOS is currently based on x11 and only supports EGL, so it cannot be used. The only thing left is `glimagesink`, according to [Running and debugging GStreamer Applications](https://gstreamer.freedesktop.org/documentation/gstreamer/running), and looking at other examples that use glimagesink, we can guess that we need to explicitly specify the environment variables `GST_GL_API` and `GST_GL_PLATFORM`. Since RevyOS uses a combination of gles2+egl, it was successfully hardened using the following command. ```shell GST_GL_API gles2 GST_GL_PLATFORM egl gst launch 1.0 filesrc location <test.mp4> ! qtdemux ! h264parse ! omxh264dec ! videoconvert ! fpsdisplaysink video sink glimagesink sync false ``` However, GStreamer cannot be passed parameters via environment variables when called by the player, so additional meson compilation parameters should be passed when building gst plugins base: ```shell Dgl_api [\\'gles2\\'] Dgl_platform [\\'egl\\'] ``` ### C. Player support After the pipeline of GStreamer is OK, we need to make the player support. Different players use different video sinks, and also have different levels of dependency on gstreamer. When adapting a player, the most important thing to do is to either (i) adapt the player to a validated video sink, or (ii) make the gstreamer pipeline support the video sink specified by the player, which is what we have done in this RevyOS adaptation. ```plain + + + + + + + + + + + + video stream + > omxh264dec + > video sink + + > player + + + + + + GStreamer + + ``` #### RevyOS adaptation log Simple troubleshooting based on [https://gstreamer.freedesktop.org/apps/](https://gstreamer.freedesktop.org/apps/) Available Updated App Name Remarks ❌ Gnash Flash Player ❌ GEntrans Debian Uncovered ❓ 20230226 Kaffeine ❌ Requires a lot of KDE related components ✔️ exists in [riscv64 repository](https://buildd.debian.org/status/package.php?p kaffeine&suite sid) ❌ On Debian amd64 Gnome, the playback window is separate from the control window, and VLC is called by default for playback ❌ Lcdgrilo Debian not included ✔️ 20230218 Parole ✔️ For XFCE ❓ No Wayland support, only x11 support ✔️ Debian amd64 Gnome Verified by ✔️ exists in [riscv64 repository](https://buildd.debian.org/status/package.php?p parole&suite sid) ❌ Songbird Debian not included ❌ Snappy Debian not included ❌ Totem requires GTK3, which does not support EGL on X11 The first player of choice was Totem, but it turns out that Totem can't specify video sinks other than gtkglsink, and RevyOS doesn't support it. I then chose Parole, which is written by GObject, and looked for the method parole_gst_constructed when constructing the parole_gst object, and set the video sink to the glimagesink as verified in the previous section, and the rough adaptation was completed. ### Summary: Adapting to RevyOS 1. Compile the driver module into the kernel, set bootloading, and set device permissions. 2. Package the omxil binary library provided by PTG into th1520 vpu. 1. modified the dependencies of th1520 vpu to depend on packages like gst omx, libomxil bellagio, etc. 2. set some postinstalls. 2. set up some postinstall operations, such as registering components with omxregister bellagio, etc. 3. Modify gst omx 1. added support for vpu omxil component in config 2. apply dmabuf patch 3. add support for h265 vp9. 4. 4. modify gst base compile time gl support to gles2+egl. 5. modify parole to support gl. 5. modify parole to support glimagesink ### Resources used in this article Patch collection: https://gist.github.com/Sakura286/26777ea8204c1819885e093806a4f7ca PTG omxil library: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1pYgCVI7WltfpskltJ RqzVUCEC21FS56"},"/hardware/en/lichee/th1520/lpi4a/7_develop.html":{"title":"System Development","content":" title: System Development keywords: Linux, Lichee, TH1520, SBC, RISCV, Kernel, SDK, Develop update: date: 2023 05 08 version: v1.0 author: wonder content: Release docs ## Yocto Linux The official development environment is based on yocto and customized by T head, which could be obtained here: https://gitee.com/thead yocto/ This section gives a brief introduction of setuping uilding Linux Yocto environment and use it to build the full image able to run on the development board. ### Setup Yocto Compilation Environment Linux SDK uses Yocto to build images, which runs under Ubuntu 18.04. It is recommended to deploy Yocto under Linux with Docker. Yocto could also be deployed under Ubuntu18.04 directly. (Refer to [T Head曳影1520Yocto用户指南.pdf](https://gitee.com/thead yocto/documents/blob/master/zh/user_guide/T Head%E6%9B%B3%E5%BD%B11520Yocto%E7%94%A8%E6%88%B7%E6%8C%87%E5%8D%97.pdf)2.2) This section includes the guide to deploy with Docker only. **It is recommended to reserve 200G disk space and more than 4G memory on the machine. The time cosumed varies because of network situation. Building with a typical Linux configuration (mininal system plus essential basic components) takes about 1.5 hours. (with i5 11400, as only a reference) Install docker with official script \t```bash \tcurl fsSL https://get.docker.com bash s docker mirror Aliyun \t``` Download dockerfile and modify username and ID \tClick here to download [linux dev master.7z](https://gitee.com/thead yocto/documents/blob/master/linux dev master.7z) ，enter `linux dev master` after decompressing，open `Dockerfile` and find following instructions \t```bash \tENV DOCKER_USER2 \"your the same user name asyour host\"` \tENV USER2_ID \"your user id\" \t``` \tChange \"your the same user name as your host\" to the name of user on host OS, \"your user id\" to the corresponding password Setup Docker image environment \t```bash \tdocker build t linux dev base:base . \t``` \tSome errors may occur during downloading packages in this step. You could modify Dockerfile and put off downloading to successfully logining. This Docker image is able to build Linux SDKs released by T Head, such as buildroot, yocto and so on. The default password is `123`. Startup Docker \t```bash \tdocker run u thead dt name linux dev {your_name} v {your_lock_home}:{your_home} linux dev base:base /bin/bash \t``` \t{your\\_name} is the name of your container. Remember not to reuse an existing name. \tIt is possible mount a directory in host with option ` v`, which could serve as a way to share files. {your\\_lock\\_home} is the local path under host, {your\\_home} is the path mounted in Docker. Check started Docker containers. \t```bash \tdocker ps grep linux dev base \t``` then started Docker containers are shown, Login Docker \t```bash \tdocker exec it linux dev {your_name} /bin/bash \t``` Download open source packages (only needed at the first time of building SDK) \tPackages will be downloaded during building the firmware, which could take a long time with a poor network connection. To speed up the process, you could download the packages from Gitee ahead of time. \t```bash \tcd ~ \tgit clone https://gitee.com/thead yocto/yocto downloads.git \t``` Download Yocto building packages \t```bash \tgit clone https://gitee.com/thead yocto/xuantie yocto.git b Linux_SDK_V1.1.2 \t``` Load configuration of targeted device and environment variables (remember to check before building) \t```bash \tcd xuantie yocto \tsource openembedded core/oe init build env thead build/light fm \t``` Create a softlink to downloaded packages in directory downloads in SDK directory. \t```bash \tln s ~/yocto downloads ../downloads \t``` Now the building environment is ready. ### Supported List of Machine/Target In the step above (load environment variables), following message is shown after successfully setuping. ```bash ### Shell environment set up for builds. ### You can now run 'bitbake <target>' Common targets are: thead image linux thead image multimedia thead image gui machines: light beagle light b product light a val light lpi4a ``` Here is the description: target (List of images supported by the SDK): NameDescription thead image linuxTypical configuration of Linux, mininal system with essential basic components thead image multimediaTypical configuration of Linux with video & CV support, mininal system with components of video subsystem (GStreamer etc.) thead image guiAll of above with GUI related components, full image, including applications like Gnome desktop, weston, QT and so on. machines (Board level configuration supported by the SDK): NameDescription light a valTH1520 A EVB Board light b productTH1520 B EVB Board light beaglebeagleV Ahead Development Board light lpi4aLichee Pi 4A Development Board ### Building images Building commands are like following: ```bash MACHINE {machine} bitbake {target} ``` Replace {machine} and {target} with corresponding names in tables above. For example, the command to build a typical Linux image running on LicheePi 4A development board is: ```bash MACHINE light lpi4a bitbake thead image linux ``` #### Problems while building images Caused by poor network, downloading may be slow and even fails at this step. Recommend proxies if possible. Error message: \t```bash \tPlease use a locale setting which supports utf 8. \tPython can't change the filesystem locale after loading so we need a utf 8 when python starts or things won't work. \t``` \tRun following commands first \t```bash \tsudo apt get install locales \tsudo dpkg reconfigure locales \t``` \tThen find `en\\_US.UTF8` in the printed list (approximately the 158th).

Enter `light fm` directory in the built image and move `sdk.sh` here. Run it with `./sdk.sh` and the corresponding image is generated after packaging. For file paths and directory structure of the image, refer to repository [light\\_deploy\\_images](https://gitee.com/thead yocto/light_deploy_images/tree/master/tarball). Finally, copy the built image and related files to the shared directory mounted with option ` v` and the file could be used for burning. Now we have finished building and packaging, resulting with an image able to burn into and run in the development board. ### Build Separately How to build official components released by T head separately OpenSBI Uboot \t```bash \tgit clone https://gitee.com/thead yocto/u boot \tcd u boot \tmake CROSS_COMPILE riscv64 unknown linux gnu ARCH riscv light_lpi4a_defconfig \tmake CROSS_COMPILE riscv64 unknown linux gnu ARCH riscv \t``` \tThe generated firmware is u boot with spl.bin, which could be burnt with fastboot.

Note that the system comes with a temperature control policy that will downclock the system when it is too idle or too hot. Please maintain good heat dissipation to keep the CPU below 60 degrees for optimal performance. ### Chip temperature `cat /sys/class/thermal/thermal_zone0/temp` Unit is 0.001 degrees Celsius. ### CPU overclocking The TH1520 runs at 1.85GHz by default, but preliminary tests show that about 80% of the chips can run at 2GHz, and about 50% of the chips can pass the stress test at 2GHz. Here is a simple overclocking procedure for reference only, no guarantee for stability and safety. Check the files under `/boot`: ```bash fw_dynamic.bin #opensbi Image #kernel image kernel release #commit id of kernel light_aon_fpga.bin #fw for E902 aon light_c906_audio.bin #fw for C906 audio light lpi4a.dtb #1.85GHz dtb light lpi4a_2Ghz.dtb #2GHz overclock dtb light lpi4a ddr2G.dtb #history dtb ``` Copy `light lpi4a_2Ghz.dtb` and overwrite it with `light lpi4a.dtb`, reboot, and then you can change the maximum frequency after booting. Note that there is a chance that it will not boot after this modification, and then you need to re burn the firmware to recover. If it boots successfully, then you can check the following values to confirm that it has been successfully overclocked: `sudo cat /sys/devices/system/cpu/cpu0/cpufreq/cpuinfo_max_freq` ## PWM Take PWM1 which is connected to the cooling fan as an example, you can get the fan speed with the following code: ```bash cat /sys/class/hwmon/hwmon0/pwm1 ``` The PWM speed value ranges from 0 to 255, where a higher value represents a higher fan speed. You can write ```1``` to the PWM enable control for manual speed regulation, and set the fan speed (e.g., 255): ``` echo 0 > /sys/class/hwmon/hwmon0/pwm1_enable echo 255 > /sys/class/hwmon/hwmon0/pwm1 ``` You can enable automatic speed regulation with the following code: ```bash echo 2 > /sys/class/hwmon/hwmon0/pwm1_enable ``` Or stop the fan completely: ```bash echo 0 > /sys/class/hwmon/hwmon0/pwm1_enable ``` ## GPIO The LicheePi 4A has 2x10pin pins on board with 16 native IOs, including 6 normal IOs, 3 pairs of serial ports, and one SPI. > Note: All native IOs of the SOC are at 1.8V level, please pay attention to the level shift. > The serial input side on the pins has been processed with 1/2 voltage divider and can be connected to a 3.3V serial port. The TH1520 SOC has 4 GPIO banks, each with a maximum of 32 IOs: Bank Address kernel io num GPIO0 0xffec005000 456 487 GPIO1 0xffec006000 424 455 GPIO2 0xffe7f34000 392 423 GPIO3 0xffe7f38000 360 391 AO_GPIO 0xfffff41000 328 359 AO_GPIO4 0xfffff52000 296 327 AUDIO_GPIO0xffcb013000 Where the 4Byte (32bit) at offset 0x0 is the GPIO data register and the 4Byte (32bit) at offset 0x4 is the GPIO direction register. The GPIO correspondences of the pins on the LicheePi 4A are(from the perspective of overlooking the front of the BOTTOM plate, TOP is the left side, BOTTOM is the right side): ![io_map](./../../../../zh/lichee/th1520/lpi4a/assets/peripheral/io_map.png) > Subject to the labeling of the document, the silkscreen labeling of the internal test version may be incorrect GPIO operation: > Note that pinmux may need to be set in advance. ```bash num xxx echo ${num} > /sys/class/gpio/export echo out > /sys/class/gpio/gpio${num}/direction echo 1 > /sys/class/gpio/gpio${num}/value echo 0 > /sys/class/gpio/gpio${num}/value ``` The mapping of GPIO is shown in the following figure： ![gpio_num](./../../../../zh/lichee/th1520/lpi4a/assets/peripheral/gpio_num.png) For example, if you want to operate the 4 GPIOs on the pin, the correspondence is as follows, change the num in the above code to the number corresponding to the GPIO pin you want to operate. numIO Number 427IO 1_3 428IO 1_4 429IO 1_5 430IO 1_6 It is also possible to manipulate registers directly: > devmem can be downloaded and compiled from here: https://github.com/VCTLabs/devmem2/blob/master/devmem2.c ```bash ./devmem 0xffe7f38000 w ``` In system GPIO information view: ```bash sipeed@lpi4a:~$ sudo cat /sys/kernel/debug/gpio ``` Here are the sample results: ![peripheral_gpio_information](./../../../../zh/lichee/th1520/lpi4a/assets/peripheral/peripheral_gpio_information.png) Next, taking GPIO1_3 on the baseplate pin as an example, we use libgpiod to operate gpio in user space. First install libgpiod: ```shell sudo apt update sudo apt install libgpiod dev ``` Then run the `vi gpio.c` command, and write the following code to the file: ```c #include <stdio.h> #include <stdlib.h> #include <unistd.h> #include <gpiod.h> int main() { int i; int ret; struct gpiod_chip * chip; struct gpiod_line * line; chip gpiod_chip_open(\"/dev/gpiochip1\"); if(chip NULL) { printf(\"gpiod_chip_open error\\n\"); return 1; } line gpiod_chip_get_line(chip, 3); if(line NULL) { printf(\"gpiod_chip_get_line error\\n\"); gpiod_line_release(line); } ret gpiod_line_request_output(line,\"gpio\",0); if(ret < 0) { printf(\"gpiod_line_request_output error\\n\"); gpiod_chip_close(chip); } for(i 0; i < 10; i++) { gpiod_line_set_value(line,1); sleep(1); gpiod_line_set_value(line,0); sleep(1); } gpiod_line_release(line); gpiod_chip_close(chip); return 0; } ``` Compile with the following command: ```shell gcc gpio.c I /usr/include/ L /usr/lib/riscv64 linux gnu/ lgpiod o gpio ``` Then execute with root privileges: ```shell sudo ./gpio ``` At this time, use a multimeter to measure the IO1_3 pin on the baseplate. You can find that the voltage of the pin changes every second. <! ```bash sipeed@lpi4a:~$ sudo cat /sys/kernel/debug/gpio gpiochip8: GPIOs 296 327, parent: platform/fffff52000.gpio, fffff52000.gpio: AO_GPIO4 gpiochip7: GPIOs 328 359, parent: platform/fffff41000.gpio, fffff41000.gpio: AO_GPIO gpio 332 ( hubswitch ) out hi gpiochip6: GPIOs 360 391, parent: platform/ffe7f38000.gpio, ffe7f38000.gpio: GPIO3 gpiochip5: GPIOs 392 423, parent: platform/ffe7f34000.gpio, ffe7f34000.gpio: GPIO2 gpio 395 ( cs ) out hi ACTIVE LOW gpio 406 ( aon:soc_vdd5v_se_en ) out lo gpio 407 ( spi0 CS0 ) out hi ACTIVE LOW gpio 417 ( Volume Up Key ) in lo IRQ ACTIVE LOW gpio 421 ( aon:soc_wcn33_en ) out lo gpiochip4: GPIOs 424 455, parent: platform/ffec006000.gpio, ffec006000.gpio: GPIO1 gpio 443 ( Volume Down Key ) in hi IRQ ACTIVE LOW gpio 446 ( aon:soc_vbus_en ) out hi gpiochip3: GPIOs 456 487, parent: platform/ffec005000.gpio, ffec005000.gpio: GPIO0 gpio 457 ( spi2 CS0 ) out hi ACTIVE LOW gpio 486 ( aon:soc_vdd_3v3_en ) out hi gpiochip2: GPIOs 488 495, parent: i2c/3 0018, 3 0018, can sleep: IO expend 3 gpio 490 ( regulator hub vdd12 ) out hi gpio 491 ( regulator hub vcc5v ) out hi gpio 492 ( regulator pwr en ) out hi gpio 493 ( aon:soc_lcd0_vdd33_e) out hi gpio 494 ( aon:soc_lcd0_vdd18_e) out hi gpio 495 ( reset ) out hi ACTIVE LOW gpiochip1: GPIOs 496 503, parent: i2c/1 0018, 1 0018, can sleep: IO expend 2 gpio 496 ( aon:soc_cam2_dvdd12_) out lo gpio 501 ( wlan_default_wlan_po) out hi gpio 502 ( bt_default_poweron ) out lo gpiochip0: GPIOs 504 511, parent: i2c/0 0018, 0 0018, can sleep: IO expend 1 gpio 504 ( aon:soc_dvdd12_rgb ) out lo gpio 505 ( aon:soc_avdd28_rgb ) out lo gpio 506 ( aon:soc_dovdd18_rgb ) out lo gpio 507 ( aon:soc_dovdd18_ir ) out lo gpio 508 ( aon:soc_dvdd12_ir ) out lo gpio 509 ( aon:soc_avdd25_ir ) out lo gpio 510 ( aon:soc_cam2_dovdd18) out lo gpio 511 ( aon:soc_cam2_avdd25_) out lo ``` ### Use of gpiod library The GPiod library is a library that can call GPIO in the same user space, making it convenient for users to operate GPIO in applications. Firstly, install and deploy the GPIO library: ```shell sudo apt install wget wget https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/libs/libgpiod/libgpiod.git/snapshot/libgpiod 2.0.tar.gz tar zxvf libgpiod 2.0.tar.gz cd libgpiod 2.0 sudo apt get install build essential pkg config m4 automake autoconf libtool autoconf archive sudo apt install gcc g++ export CC gcc export CXX g++ #Deploy the relevant files of the library to the project folder: The path after prefix should be changed to the path where the project is located for future operations ./autogen.sh enable tools yes prefix /home/sipeed/mylib_local make sudo make install ``` 如果执行：./autogen.sh enable tools yes prefix /home/sipeed/mylib_local 出现以下错误： ```shell aclocal: warning: couldn't open directory 'm4': No such file or directory #You can execute the following commands mkdir m4 ./autogen.sh enable tools yes prefix /home/sipeed/mylib_local make make install ``` Start operating GPIO: ```shell sudo vim gpio.c #The content of gpio. c is as follows: #include<stdio.h> #include<unistd.h> #include<gpiod.h> #define PIN_IO1_3 3 #define PIN_IO1_4 4 #define PIN_IO1_5 5 int main() { struct gpiod_chip *gchip; struct gpiod_line_info *glinein, *glineout; struct gpiod_line_settings *gline_settings_in, *gline_settings_out; struct gpiod_line_config *gline_config_in, *gline_config_out; struct gpiod_request_config *gline_request_config_in, *gline_request_config_out; struct gpiod_line_request *gline_request_in, *gline_request_out; int offset_in[1] {PIN_IO1_5}; int offset_out[2] {PIN_IO1_3, PIN_IO1_4}; int value; if ((gchip gpiod_chip_open(\"/dev/gpiochip4\")) NULL) { perror(\"gpiod_chip_open\"); return 1; } gline_settings_in gpiod_line_settings_new(); if ((value gpiod_line_settings_set_direction(gline_settings_in, GPIOD_LINE_DIRECTION_INPUT)) ! 0) { perror(\"gpiod_line_settings_set_direction\"); } gline_config_in gpiod_line_config_new(); value gpiod_line_config_add_line_settings(gline_config_in, offset_in, 1, gline_settings_in); gline_request_config_in gpiod_request_config_new(); gline_request_in gpiod_chip_request_lines(gchip, gline_request_config_in, gline_config_in); value gpiod_line_request_get_value(gline_request_in, PIN_IO1_5); printf(\"IO1 5 %d\\n\", value); gline_settings_out gpiod_line_settings_new(); if (gpiod_line_settings_set_direction(gline_settings_out, GPIOD_LINE_DIRECTION_OUTPUT) ! 0) { perror(\"gpiod_line_settings_set_direction\"); } gline_config_out gpiod_line_config_new(); gpiod_line_config_add_line_settings(gline_config_out, offset_out, 2, gline_settings_out); gline_request_config_out gpiod_request_config_new(); gline_request_out gpiod_chip_request_lines(gchip, gline_request_config_out, gline_config_out); value gpiod_line_request_set_value(gline_request_out, PIN_IO1_3, 1); value gpiod_line_request_set_value(gline_request_out, PIN_IO1_4, 0); printf(\"IO1 3 1, IO1 4 0\\n\"); sleep(1); for (int i 0; i < 10; i++) { value gpiod_line_request_get_value(gline_request_in, PIN_IO1_5); printf(\"IO1 5 %d\\n\", value); value gpiod_line_request_set_value(gline_request_out, PIN_IO1_3, 0); value gpiod_line_request_set_value(gline_request_out, PIN_IO1_4, 1); printf(\"IO1 3 0, IO1 4 1\\n\"); sleep(1); value gpiod_line_request_get_value(gline_request_in, PIN_IO1_5); printf(\"IO1 5 %d\\n\", value); value gpiod_line_request_set_value(gline_request_out, PIN_IO1_3, 1); value gpiod_line_request_set_value(gline_request_out, PIN_IO1_4, 0); printf(\"IO1 3 1, IO1 4 0\\n\"); sleep(1); } gpiod_chip_close(gchip); return 0; } ``` Save and compile ```shell gcc I/home/sipeed/mylib_local/include L/home/sipeed/mylib_local/lib o gpio gpio.c lgpiod ``` Some device permissions need to be granted before execution ```shell export LD_LIBRARY_PATH /home/sipeed/mylib_local/lib:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH export PATH /home/sipeed/mylib_local/bin:$PATH sudo chmod o+rw /dev/gpiochip4 sudo chmod o+rw /dev/spidev2.0 #It can be directly executed in an. sh file ``` Run program: ```shell ./gpio ``` The console output is as follows: ```shell sipeed@lpi4a:~/gpio$ ./gpio IO1 5 1 IO1 3 1, IO1 4 0 IO1 5 1 IO1 3 0, IO1 4 1 IO1 5 1 IO1 3 1, IO1 4 0 IO1 5 1 IO1 3 0, IO1 4 1 IO1 5 1 IO1 3 1, IO1 4 0 IO1 5 1 IO1 3 0, IO1 4 1 IO1 5 1 IO1 3 1, IO1 4 0 IO1 5 1 IO1 3 0, IO1 4 1 IO1 5 1 IO1 3 1, IO1 4 0 IO1 5 1 IO1 3 0, IO1 4 1 ``` > ## UART ### System Serial Port The system serial port of the LicheePi 4A is UART0, which is shown on the side pins. You can use a USB to serial module to connect to this serial port, i.e. `U0 RX` and `U0 TX`, taking care of the cross connections and the GND connection. ![ttl_link](./../../../../zh/lichee/th1520/lpi4a/assets/peripheral/ttl_link.png) After the connection is completed, you can use serial tools to communicate, we recommend `XShell` and `mobaterm` for Windows and `minicom` for Linux. Set the serial port baud rate to `115200`, then you can log in the serial terminal and do the command operation: > Note: Just after connecting, you can hit several carriage returns to see if there is any response, if there is no response, then check the wiring or serial port configuration. ![ttl_login](./../../../../zh/lichee/th1520/lpi4a/assets/peripheral/ttl_login.png) ### General serial port The LicheePi 4A also has UART1/2/3 on the side pins, which can also be operated. Only UART1 is enabled in the default image, other ports may need to reconfigure the device tree for operation. > Note: The SOC serial port level is 1.8V, which is just around the high level threshold of 3.3V, some serial modules may not be able to input/output correctly, we suggest to use our matching serial modules, or fine tune the 3.3V voltage of other serial modules to 2.8V. #### View Serial Devices ```bash ls /dev/ttyS* ``` #### View serial port baud rate and other information ```bash stty F /dev/ttyS1 a ``` #### Set serial port baud rate, data mode ```bash stty F /dev/ttyS1 ispeed 115200 ospeed 115200 cs8 ``` #### Viewing serial port data ```bash cat /dev/ttyS1 ``` #### Send serial port data ```bash echo \"12345\" > /dev/ttyS1 ``` #### Other methods You can also use ``minicom``, or pyserial library for serial port operation, please find the relevant information for users to use. ## I2C There are several I2C devices (I2C0/1/2/3) on the LicheePi 4A, where 0/1/3 is used to connect to the I2C IO expansion chip, and I2C2 is reserved on the external pin. Here we use i2c tools for i2c authentication, which are pre installed in the image. ```bash sipeed@lpi4a:/usr$ ls /sbin/i2c* /sbin/i2c stub from dump /sbin/i2cdetect /sbin/i2cdump /sbin/i2cget /sbin/i2cset /sbin/i2ctransfer ``` List all I2C buses: ```bash sipeed@lpi4a:~$ /sbin/i2cdetect l i2c 0 unknown Synopsys DesignWare I2C adapter N/A i2c 1 unknown Synopsys DesignWare I2C adapter N/A i2c 2 unknown Synopsys DesignWare I2C adapter N/A i2c 3 unknown Synopsys DesignWare I2C adapter N/A i2c 4 unknown Synopsys DesignWare I2C adapter N/A i2c 5 unknown Synopsys DesignWare I2C adapter N/A i2c 6 unknown Synopsys DesignWare I2C adapter N/A i2c 7 unknown DesignWare HDMI N/A ``` Detecting the device on the I2C bus, we can see that the I2C address of PCA9557PW is 0x18, which is consistent with the schematic: ```bash sipeed@lpi4a:~$ sudo /sbin/i2cdetect r y 0 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 a b c d e f 00: 10: UU 20: 30: 40: 50: 60: 70: ``` ![i2c_io](./../../../../zh/lichee/th1520/lpi4a/assets/peripheral/i2c_io.png) It is also possible to use `i2cdump` to dump all registers at the specified i2c address, `i2cget` to read the specified register value at the specified i2c address, and `i2cset` to write the specified register value at the specified i2c address. However, since the IO extension chip is already used by the kernel, it is not possible to verify these commands directly. Users can verify it by connecting peripheral devices to I2C2 by themselves. ## SPI There are two SPIs reserved on the LicheePi4A, one on the SPI Flash pads that are blanked out on the back, and one on the pins. ```bash sipeed@lpi4a:~$ ls /dev/spidev2.0 /dev/spidev2.0 ``` <! ### Start Pay attention to the IO drive capability. Licheepi4A requires an external level conversion chip and uses TXS10108E for its own use All programs of this routine are compiled on the board. If cross coding is necessary, the tool chain can be replaced during compilation. The GPIO operation of the following routine is based on the GPIOD library above. #### 1.Download the source code ```shell git clone https://github.com/fffdee/ST7735_for_Licheepi4A.git ``` #### 2.Building the GPIOD library Dependencies required for installation: ```shell sudo apt get install build essential pkg config m4 automake autoconf libtool autoconf archive sudo apt install gcc g++ gpiod cmake ``` Install the GPIOD library (the source file is already installed, and the library path needs to be changed. Please refer to the following steps): ```shell tar zxvf libgpiod 2.0.tar.gz cd libgpiod 2.0 export CC gcc export CXX g++ #Deploy the relevant files of the library to the project folder: The path after prefix should be changed to the path where the project is located for future operations ./autogen.sh enable tools yes prefix /home/sipeed/TFT_demo/ make sudo make install #Installation completed ``` #### 3.Compile and Run ```shell cd TFT_demo cmake . make j4 #授予设备权限，每次开机执行一次即可 . exec.sh ./tft_demo ``` #### Renderings ![效果图1](./../../../../zh/lichee/th1520/lpi4a/assets/peripheral/tft_demo.png) > Common ioctl commands for SPI: SPI_IOC_MESSAGE: sends and receives SPI messages. It can be used to read and write data and control devices SPI_IOC_WR_MODE: Set the working mode of the SPI device, such as CPOL and CPHA SPI_IOC_RD_MODE: Reads the working mode of the SPI device SPI_IOC_WR_LSB_FIRST: Sets the byte order of the SPI device, that is, whether the highest bit is transmitted first or the lowest bit is transmitted first SPI_IOC_RD_LSB_FIRST: reads the byte order of the SPI device SPI_IOC_WR_BITS_PER_WORD: sets the data bit width of the SPI device SPI_IOC_RD_BITS_PER_WORD: Used to read the bit width of the SPI device SPI_IOC_WR_MAX_SPEED_HZ: specifies the maximum clock frequency of an SPI device SPI_IOC_RD_MAX_SPEED_HZ: Reads the maximum clock frequency of an SPI device SPI_IOC_WR_MODE32: Sets the 32 bit mode of the SPI device, such as CPOL and CPHA SPI_IOC_RD_MODE32: indicates the 32 bit mode used to read the SPI device The above are some common SPI device ioctl commands, which can be used to configure and control various parameters of the SPI device. Turn on/off SPI device: ```c int open(const char *pathname, int flags); int close(int fd); ``` Header files needed: ```c #include<fcntl.h> #include<unistd.h> ``` Example code: ```c #include <stdint.h> #include <unistd.h> // C 语言标准头文件，定义了 POSIX API 的一部分，如文件操作、进程管理等 #include <stdio.h> #include <stdlib.h> #include <string.h> #include <getopt.h> #include <fcntl.h> // C 语言头文件，定义了文件控制相关的宏和函数 #include <sys/ioctl.h> // C 语言头文件，定义了 ioctl 函数和相关宏 #include <linux/types.h> // Linux 内核头文件，定义了内核中使用的一些基本数据类型 #include <linux/spi/spidev.h> // Linux SPI 子系统头文件，定义了 SPI 设备驱动程序使用的数据结构和 ioctl 命令 #define DATA_NUM 2 // 自定义数据长度 #define CHECK(ret, str) if (ret < 0) {printf(\"%s\\r\\n\", str); return ret;} static uint8_t bits 8; static uint32_t speed 1000000; // 1M Hz static int mode 0; int main(int argc, char *argv[]) { int ret, fd; fd open(\"/dev/spidev2.0\", O_RDWR); CHECK(fd, \"can't open device\"); // 打开具体 spi 设备 mode SPI_MODE_0 SPI_CS_HIGH; ret ioctl(fd, SPI_IOC_WR_MODE32, &mode); //设置 SPI 模式 CHECK(ret, \"can't set spi mode\"); ret ioctl(fd, SPI_IOC_RD_MODE32, &mode); //获取 SPI 模式设置 CHECK(ret, \"can't get spi mode\"); ret ioctl(fd, SPI_IOC_WR_BITS_PER_WORD, &bits); //设置 SPI 的 bit/word CHECK(ret, \"can't set bits per word\"); ret ioctl(fd, SPI_IOC_RD_BITS_PER_WORD, &bits); //获取 SPI 的 bit/word 设置 CHECK(ret, \"can't get bits per word\"); ret ioctl(fd, SPI_IOC_WR_MAX_SPEED_HZ, &speed); //设置 SPI 的最大传输速度 CHECK(ret, \"can't set max speed hz\"); ret ioctl(fd, SPI_IOC_RD_MAX_SPEED_HZ, &speed); //获取 SPI 的最大传输速度设置 CHECK(ret, \"can't get max speed hz\"); printf(\"spi mode: %d\\n\", mode); printf(\"bits per word: %d\\n\", bits); printf(\"max speed: %d Hz (%d KHz)\\n\", speed, speed/1000); //数据传输 uint8_t tx[] {0x11, 0x22}; uint8_t rx[DATA_NUM] {0}; struct spi_ioc_transfer tr { .tx_buf (unsigned long)tx, //定义发送缓冲区指针 .rx_buf (unsigned long)rx, //定义接收缓冲区指针 .len DATA_NUM, .delay_usecs 0, .speed_hz speed, .bits_per_word bits }; ret ioctl(fd, SPI_IOC_MESSAGE(1), &tr); //执行 spidev.c 中 ioctl 的 default 进行数据传输 CHECK(ret, \"can't send spi message\"); printf(\"tx: %.2X %.2X\\r\\n\", tx[0], tx[1]); printf(\"rx: %.2X %.2X\\r\\n\", rx[0], rx[1]); close(fd); return ret; } ``` ## USB Connect the USB SSD: ![usb_ssd_connect](./../../../../zh/lichee/th1520/lpi4a/assets/peripheral/usb_ssd_connect.jpg) The corresponding device can be seen in the system: ![usb_ssd_use](./../../../../zh/lichee/th1520/lpi4a/assets/peripheral/usb_ssd_use.png) ### USB network card Connect the USB network card: ![usb_lan_connect](./../../../../zh/lichee/th1520/lpi4a/assets/peripheral/usb_lan_connect.jpg) 右上角的网络图标会变为已连接有线网的状态： ![usb_lan_use](./../../../../zh/lichee/th1520/lpi4a/assets/peripheral/usb_lan_use.png) 终端中使用`sudo ifconfig`命令，也可以看到相应设备的信息： ![check_usb_lan_ip](./../../../../zh/lichee/th1520/lpi4a/assets/peripheral/check_usb_lan_ip.png) ### USB Camera Connect the USB camera: ![usb_cam_connect](./../../../../zh/lichee/th1520/lpi4a/assets/peripheral/usb_cam_connect.jpg) After installing guvcview, use the appropriate commands to see the image stream from the USB camera: ```shell sudo apt get install guvcview guvcview ``` ![usb_cam_use](./../../../../zh/lichee/th1520/lpi4a/assets/peripheral/usb_cam_use.png) You can end the image stream by pressing Ctrl+C or by clicking the quit button on the guvcview window. You can also use fswebcam to dump the USB camera image directly from the command line. ```shell sudo apt get install fswebcam fswebcam /dev/video0 image.jpg ``` To allow the USB camera to automatically save images, a reference script is given below. The script uses the uvccapture tool, which makes it easy to adjust capture parameters as needed. Install this tool first ```shell sudo apt install uvccapture ``` This tool supports various parameters, use ` x y` to adjust the shooting resolution, ` B` to adjust the brightness, ` C` to adjust the contrast, ` S` to adjust the saturation, and ` o` to specify the shooting image storage Path, for specific use, refer to the following script code: ```shell #!/bin/bash # Check if the interval time parameter is passed in if [ z \"$1\" ]; then echo e \"The interval time parameter is not specified, and the default interval is 1 second\" interval 1 else interval $1 the fi # Check if the output file path parameter is passed in if [ z \"$2\" ]; then echo e \"The output file path parameter is not specified, the default output is to the current directory\" output_file \"$PWD\" else output_file $2 the fi # Check whether the number of shots parameter is passed in if [ z \"$3\" ]; then echo e \"The number of shots is not specified, the default is 10 shots\" num_executions 10 else num_executions $3 the fi echo e \"script started, press q to stop\" for ((i 1; i < num_executions; i++)); do echo e \"capture img $i\" uvccapture x640 y480 m o$output_file/$image$i.jpg # Take pictures at specified time intervals sleep $interval # Press the q key to exit read t 1 n 1 key if [[ $key \"q\" ]]; then break the fi done echo e \"Script execution ended\" ``` The above script can also be operated with fswebcam, just make corresponding changes. ### USB Sound Card TODO ## ETH The LicheePi4A has dual Gigabit Ethernet ports, of which Eth0 is also PoE capable. TODO ### PoE The Ethernet 0 interface of LicheePi 4A has PoE function and can be powered by PoE. The PoE power supply module needs to be purchased on its own, and can be found by searching for the keyword \"5V PoE pin\" in the 5V voltage, 35.6mm length specification. When the visual direction is facing the \"POE POWER\" logo, the four pins on the left side of the pin are defined from left to right as: VA1, VA2, VB1, VB2, and on the right side as: GND, 5VIN. ## Audio There are two analog silicon mics on the LicheePi 4A, using the ES7210 CODEC, as well as having on board speakers all the way, and stereo headphones, using the ES8156 CODEC. > Note: The on board speakers and stereo headphones use a mutually exclusive design; when headphones are plugged in, the audio output automatically switches to the headphones and the on board speakers are deactivated. Simple recording and playback tests can be performed using aplay and arecord, note that the onboard speakers are right channel. ```bash #!/bin/bash echo \"Play Test Audio\" aplay /usr/share/sounds/alsa/Side_Right.wav # Record Audio echo \"Start record auido, auto replay after 3 seconds\" arecord Dhw:0,1 d 3 r 48000 f S16_LE t wav test.wav & > /dev/null & sleep 4 # Play Audio aplay test.wav echo \"Start Play\" ``` You can also use alsa related tools, such as `alsamixer`, to do things like volume adjustments. ## HDMI Audio > Note: HDMI audio does not work for earlier mirrors, please upgrade to a newer version to enable HDMI audio function. Tap the speaker icon at the top right corner of the screen to enter Audio mixer, you can see the interface below: ![audiomixer](./../../../../zh/lichee/th1520/lpi4a/assets/peripheral/audiomixer.png) The name of the device is **Built in Audio**, i.e. HDMI audio, and you can switch between audio devices by clicking on its corresponding green checkmark icon in this interface, or you can switch between devices by clicking on the small speaker icon directly. If you confirm that the connection is correct and the HDMI monitor you are using supports HDMI audio, but you do not see the corresponding device in the device list, you can try to run the following command: ```shell systemctl user restart pulseaudio.service ``` ## MIPI CSI LicheePi 4A has three camera interfaces, CAM0/CAM1/CAM2, CAM0 is up to 4 lanes, CAM1/2 is 2 lanes, and the default is to use the CSI0 interface to connect to the OV5693 camera. Connections are made as shown below, using the CSI0 connector with the camera's gold finger facing down: ![mipi_csi_connect.jpg](./../../../../zh/lichee/th1520/lpi4a/assets/peripheral/mipi_csi_connect.jpg) Currently, we need to burn a dedicated mirror for testing for the time being, download /image/latest_20230714/LPI4A_YOCTO_CAM.zip from [Baidu.com](https://pan.baidu.com/e/1xH56ZlewB6UOMlke5BrKWQ) in the Documentation Mirror Collection page. image file. After burning, go to the /usr/share/csi_hal/ directory and run the following command: ```shell ./cam_demo_simple 2 0 1 0 640 480 1 30 ``` After the completion of the run, you can see in the current directory dump down to the shooting photos, typically named demo_save_img_OV5693_ch0_0_*, resolution of 640\\*480 (currently only supports 640 * 480 resolution), the format is YUV420SP (NV12), the format of the UV component of the interleaving of the storage, bit depth The format is YUV420SP(NV12), under this format, the UV components are interleaved, and the bit depth is 8bit. Under Linux, you can use YUView to set the relevant parameters to view the image; in addition, you can also use python to process the relevant parameters to view the image, the reference code is as follows: ```python import numpy as np import cv2 class nv12_to_jpg: def __init__(self): return def to_jpg(self, yuv_path, resolution): width, height resolution with open(yuv_path, 'rb') as f: yuvdata np.fromfile(f, dtype np.uint8) self.input_file yuv_path cv_format cv2.COLOR_YUV2RGB_NV21 bgr_img cv2.cvtColor(yuvdata.reshape((height*3//2, width)), cv_format) return bgr_img def save(self, img_data, output_path): cv2.imwrite(output_path, img_data) if __name__ \"__main__\": # Example: Convert an image in 10bit raw format to jpg format file_name input(\"Please enter the filename of the raw image:\") input_str input(\"width and hight, separated by spaces:\") width, height map(int, input_str.split()) img nv12_to_jpg() jpg_data img.to_jpg(file_name, (width, height)) img.save(jpg_data, file_name+'nv12tojpg.jpg') ``` ## MIPI DSI LicheePi 4A has MIPI DSI0 interface, supports 4K video output, and can be equipped with 10.1 inch 1280x800 or 1920x1200 screen. Connection method is shown below, both fpc cables are downward connected (the side of the metal contact at the end of the cable is facing downward), in which the adapter plate of the touch screen needs to pay attention to the direction when connecting, make sure that the end of ToLPi4A is connected to the touch soft cable of LPi4A, and the end of ToLcdTP is connected to the screen: FPC Schematic: ![fpc](./../../../../zh/lichee/th1520/lpi4a/assets/peripheral/fpc.jpg) Note that before connecting, first dial up the black flap on the interface used to fix the wires, and then dial down after confirming the connection. Touch panel FPC connection: ![tpconnector_on_touchscreen](./../../../../zh/lichee/th1520/lpi4a/assets/peripheral/tpconnector_on_touchscreen.jpeg) ![touchconnector_on_board](./../../../../zh/lichee/th1520/lpi4a/assets/peripheral/touchconnector_on_board.jpeg) MIPI screen FPC connection: ![mipi_dsi_connect](./../../../../zh/lichee/th1520/lpi4a/assets/peripheral/mipi_dsi_connect.jpeg) After confirming the connection is correct, use the firmware that supports MIPI screen, and power on the device to see the MIPI screen display. If you only use the MIPI screen, you can turn off the HDMI display and set the MIPI screen as the main screen in the system settings, or you can use the following command: ```shell xrandr output HDMI 1 off xrandr output DSI 1 rotate normal primary ``` In the above command, the `rotate` parameter is the rotation direction of the screen, `normal` means no rotation, i.e. vertical display, if you want to continue to display horizontal screen, you can change it to `left` or `right`. If you use both MIPI screen and HDMI screen, you can also set the relationship between the main screen and the two screens according to the above commands. For example, the following command sets the HDMI screen as the main screen, and sets the MIPI screen as the extended screen below the main screen, and displays the screen in landscape: ```shell xrandr output HDMI 1 auto primary xrandr output DSI 1 rotate left below HDMI 1 ``` The above screen identifiers and available resolutions can be viewed directly by entering the `xrandr` command. If you find that the coordinates of the touch screen are not correct after modifying the settings, you can follow the steps below to correct them: Check the corresponding ID of the touch screen device ```shell xinput ``` ![list_touchsreen](./../../../../zh/lichee/th1520/lpi4a/assets/peripheral/list_touchsreen.png) Here you can see that it is a touch screen device Goodix 7, then enter the following command to map the touch device to the correct screen: ```shell xinput map to output 7 DSI 1 ``` Similarly, depending on the ID, the following command can be used to turn off the appropriate touch device: ```shell xinput disable 7 ``` If you are using only the HDMI screen, first power down and unplug both the MIPI screen and the touchpad's flexible cable before powering up. Then run the following commands (you need to switch to root user to execute, direct sudo may encounter the problem of insufficient privileges): ```shell echo off > /sys/class/drm/card0 DSI 1/status ``` ## JTAG The JTAG interface is reserved on the core board, but you need to lead out the GND, TDI, TDO, TMS, TCK flying wires yourself. The schematic diagram of the wires that need to be led out is as follows: ![jtag_connect_out](./../../../../zh/lichee/th1520/lpi4a/assets/peripheral/jtag_connect_out.jpg) Before connecting the debugger, make sure the debugger is in CKLink mode. Next, take [SLogic Combo 8](https://en.wiki.sipeed.com/hardware/zh/logic_analyzer/combo8/index.html) and RV Debugger Plus as examples. For SLogic Combo 8, please refer to the [corresponding document](https://en.wiki.sipeed.com/hardware/en/logic_analyzer/combo8/use_cklink_function.html) to switch to CKLink mode. For RV Debugger Plus, please refer to [this repository](https://github.com/bouffalolab/bouffalo_sdk/tree/master/tools/cklink_firmware) to flash the CKLink dedicated firmware.**Note: it is better to connect a level conversion chip, direct connection has the risk of burning.** After completing the above steps, connect to the debugger using dupont wires through the pin headers. ![jtag_connect_pin](./../../../../zh/lichee/th1520/lpi4a/assets/peripheral/jtag_connect_pin.jpg) After connecting to the JTAG debugger, use the memtool in the serial port to set up pinmux(This step runs on the LPI4A board, the memtool is also installed on the LPI4A board): ```shell sudo apt install memtool sudo memtool mw 0xfffff4a404 0 ``` This pinmux setting will not work after shutdown. Because the JTAG pin is used as the USB route selection function, it is enough to set pinmux every time you debug. Next, download and install the debug server from [Pingtouge official website](https://xuantie.t head.cn/community/download?id 4209675990638596096). After the download is complete, refer to [Pingtouge Official Document](https://occ oss prod.oss cn hangzhou.aliyuncs.com/resource//1682234034575/T Head+Debugger+Server+User+Guide+%28ZH CN%29.pdf) installation. After confirming that the device is connected and pinmux is set correctly, take Linux as an example, use the command `DebugServerConsole` to open DebugServerConsole: ![open_debugserver](./../../../../zh/lichee/th1520/lpi4a/assets/peripheral/open_debugserver.png) You can see a successful connection: ![check_debugserver](./../../../../zh/lichee/th1520/lpi4a/assets/peripheral/check_debugserver.png) ## GPU Use the following command to view the status of the GPU in real time: ```shell sudo watch cat /sys/kernel/debug/pvr/status ``` Under the xfce desktop, the status of the GPU is as follows: ![gpu_status_desktop](./../../../../zh/lichee/th1520/lpi4a/assets/peripheral/gpu_status_desktop.png) When playing video with Chromium browser, the state of GPU is as follows: ![gpu_status_play_video](./../../../../zh/lichee/th1520/lpi4a/assets/peripheral/gpu_status_play_video.png) ## NPU > **Note**: To use the NPU driver, you need to upgrade to the [20230920](https://mega.nz/folder/phoQlBTZ#cZeQ3qZ__pDvP94PT3_bGA) or newer version image, this image will automatically load NPU related drivers on boot. LicheePi4A contains a 1GHz NPU supporting 4TOPS@INT8 general purpose NNA computing power. The Wiki contains examples of NPU support as follows: Example NameExample FunctionalityUsage ModelInterfaceHHB Version Mobilenetv2 do image classificationimage classificationmobilenetv2c/c++2.4 and above YOLOv5 do object detectionobject detectionYOLOv5python2.4 and above RTMPose do pose estimationpose estimationRTMPosepython2.6 and above In order to cross compile the models in the above examples into executables on LicheePi4A, we first need to set up the HHB development environment on our own computer. > Recommended environment: Ubuntu 20.04 system, Docker version 20.10.21.It is recommended to use the Docker image to set up the environment. ### Installation **LPi4A setup** #### SHL Library Installation To install the SHL library, you can use pip: ```shell pip3 install shl python ``` After the installation, you can use the ` whereis` option to check the installation location. For example: ```shell python3 m shl whereis th1520 # Replace with # python3 m shl whereis c920 # if using CPU inference only ``` Based on the printed location, copy the dynamic library files from that directory to the `/usr/lib` directory. For example, if the printed location is: ```shell /home/sipeed/ort/lib/python3.11/site packages/shl/install_nn2/th1520 ``` You can use the following copy command: ```shell sudo cp /home/sipeed/ort/lib/python3.11/site packages/shl/install_nn2/th1520/lib/* /usr/lib/ ``` #### Python Virtual Environment Before installing the Python package, you need to set up a Python virtual environment. Use the following commands to install the `venv` package for creating a Python virtual environment (here, creating a Python virtual environment in the root directory): ```shell sudo i apt install python3.11 venv cd /root python3 m venv ort source /root/ort/bin/activate ``` #### HHB onnxruntime Installation HHB onnxruntime is a ported backend (execution providers) for SHL, enabling onnxruntime to reuse the high performance optimization code for XuanTie CPUs. For CPU version: ```shell wget https://github.com/zhangwm pt/onnxruntime/releases/download/riscv_whl_v2.6.0/hhb_onnxruntime_c920 2.6.0 cp311 cp311 linux_riscv64.whl pip install hhb_onnxruntime_c920 2.6.0 cp311 cp311 linux_riscv64.whl ``` For NPU version: ```shell wget https://github.com/zhangwm pt/onnxruntime/releases/download/riscv_whl_v2.6.0/hhb_onnxruntime_th1520 2.6.0 cp311 cp311 linux_riscv64.whl pip install hhb_onnxruntime_th1520 2.6.0 cp311 cp311 linux_riscv64.whl ``` **x86 Hosts setup** First, we need to install Docker on our own computer. Uninstall any existing Docker version: ```shell sudo apt get remove docker docker engine docker.io containerd runc ``` Install the basic software Docker depends on: ```shell sudo apt get update sudo apt get install apt transport https ca certificates curl gnupg agent software properties common Add the official source: ```shell curl fsSL https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu/gpg sudo apt key add sudo add apt repository \"deb [arch amd64] https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu $(lsb_release cs) stable\" ``` Install Docker: ```shell sudo apt get update sudo apt get install docker ce docker ce cli containerd.io ``` After installation, get the Docker image of the HHB environment: ```shell docker pull hhb4tools/hhb:2.4.5 ``` Once the image is pulled, enter the Docker image using the following command: ```shell docker run itd name your.hhb2.4 p 22 \"hhb4tools/hhb:2.4.5\" docker exec it your.hhb2.4 /bin/bash ``` Once you are inside the Docker image, you can use the following command to verify the HHB version: ```shell hhb version ``` Once you are in the Docker image, you need to configure the cross compile environment. Note that you must use the toolchain here, otherwise the compiled binaries will not run on LicheePi4A. ```shell export PATH /tools/Xuantie 900 gcc linux 5.10.4 glibc x86_64 V2.6.1 light.1/bin/:$PATH ``` clone NPU example code： ```shell git clone https://github.com/zhangwm pt/lpi4a example.git ``` At this point, the HHB environment is preliminarily built. You can try the following NPU examples: [Mobilenetv2 for image classification](https://wiki.sipeed.com/hardware/eh/lichee/th1520/lpi4a/8_application.html#MobilenertV2) [YOLOv5 for object detection](https://wiki.sipeed.com/hardware/eh/lichee/th1520/lpi4a/8_application.html#Yolov5n) For further infomation please check [hhb tools doc](https://www.yuque.com/za4k4z). ## Other Contributions are welcome~ You can get ￥5~150 ($1~20) coupon if your contribution is accepted!"},"/hardware/en/lichee/th1520/lpi4a/7_develop_mainline.html":{"title":"Mainline Linux","content":" title: Mainline Linux keywords: Linux, Lichee, TH1520, SBC, RISCV, Kernel, SDK, Develop update: date: 2023 09 17 version: v1.1 author: ztd content: Update docs date: 2023 05 08 version: v1.0 author: wonder content: Release docs ## Mainline Linux Note that mainstream Linux support is not yet complete, this documentation will also be updated accordingly as support improves. ### Preface The Linux mainline included some patches in v6.5 rc1 to provide support for the Lichee Pi 4A board. This article introduces the process of building and running Linux v6.5 rc1 for the LicheePi 4A development board, achieving the effect of: the kernel can successfully start and enter the initramfs command line interface. ### Software Versions SoftwareVersion Linux6.5 rc1 U Boot2020.01 OpenSBI0.9 Buildroot2023.02.2 ### Build U Boot、OpenSBI U Boot and OpenSBI mainly use the official versions provided by Sipeed, see the relevant sections on building U Boot and OpenSBI in the [RevyOS documentation](https://wiki.sipeed.com/hardware/en/lichee/th1520/lpi4a/7_develop_revyos.html). ### Build dtb When trying to boot with the device tree included in Linux v6.5 rc1, the system will error during PLIC initialization: ```shell [ 0.000000] Oops load access fault [#1] [ 0.000000] epc : __plic_toggle+0x6a/0x72 ``` Since it was not possible to verify if there were bugs in the device tree, the device tree compiled with the official Sipeed SDK was used instead. According to the [RevyOS documentation](https://wiki.sipeed.com/hardware/en/lichee/th1520/lpi4a/7_develop_revyos.html), after building the kernel, the device tree files are: arch/riscv/boot/dts/thead/light lpi4a.dtb (for 8GB RAM core board); arch/riscv/boot/dts/thead/light lpi4a 16gb.dtb (for 16GB RAM core board). ### Build initramfs It is relatively simple to build initramfs using Buildroot, just need some basic configuration and it can automatically compile and generate it. #### Configure processor architecture In the Buildroot directory, enter: ```shell make menuconfig ``` Check the RISC V： ```shell Target options > Target Architecture () > (X) RISCV ``` #### Configuration file system type Set the file system type to CPIO: ```shell Filesystem images > [*] cpio the root file system(for use as an initial RAM filesystem) ``` #### Configure kernel Once initramfs is built, you need to enable initramfs in the kernel configuration and specify the location of the generated CPIO file. ```shell General Setup > [*] Initial RAM filesystem and RAM disk (initramfs/initrd) support () Initramfs source file(s) ``` ### Build Kernel The process of building the Linux v6.5 rc1 kernel is similar to [RevyOS documentation](https://wiki.sipeed.com/hardware/en/lichee/th1520/lpi4a/7_develop_revyos.html) in the process of building the kernel, It is only necessary to change the kernel configuration to use defconfig under RISC V architecture: ```shell make CROSS_COMPILE riscv64 unknown linux gnu ARCH riscv defconfig ``` #### Serial port fails to work When trying to start on the development board using the directly compiled Linux v6.5 rc1 kernel, the serial port output will jam and will not continue to display, the related log is as follows: ```shell [ 0.876673] Warning: unable to open an initial console. [ 0.884088] Freeing unused kernel image (initmem) memory: 3744K [ 0.895429] Run /init as init process ``` The following will introduce the solution of the problem and the solution. #### Troubleshooting The following steps consider the possible causes of the problem from the root file system, kernel startup parameters, device tree, and kernel driver, and then check them in turn. ##### root file system The most common reason for this problem is that the console file is missing from the root file system, so you need to enter the following command in the /dev directory of the root file system to create it: ```shell mknod m 660 console c 5 1 mknod m 660 null c 1 3 ``` Opening the /dev directory and finding that the console file is not missing does not solve the problem, and when running the built kernel file and initramfs on the QEMU emulator, the QEMU emulator can start up and enter the command line interface of initramfs, so we can infer that the built initramfs can be used. ##### kernel startup parameters When the kernel starts, it needs to be passed some command line parameters by the Bootloader.The console parameter specifies the output port used after the kernel starts, which is usually set to console ttyS0,115200.If the development board serial port provides a baud rate other than 115200, it needs to be changed. When using U Boot as the Bootloader, you can enter the U Boot command line interface by pressing the Enter key at the start countdown, and enter the printenv command to see the kernel boot parameters bootargs, and you can change the parameter by entering the setenv command. The boot parameters are also printed in the kernel's boot log, such as: ```shell [ 0.000000] Kernel command line: console ttyS0,115200 rootwait rw earlycon init /lib/systemd/systemd ``` It is also important to note that the bootconsole used at the kernel start is not affected by the boot parameter console. ```shell [ 0.000000] earlycon: uart0 at MMIO32 0x000000ffe7014000 (options '115200n8') [ 0.000000] printk: bootconsole [uart0] enabled ``` ##### device tree Then we considered whether there was a problem with the device tree, but the device tree used was provided by the development board manufacturer Sipeed, and it could successfully start the RevyOS provided by the manufacturer (based on Linux v5.10.113). Therefore, it was inferred that the device tree could be used normally. ##### kernel driver Other factors have been almost excluded, and only the kernel related factors may have problems.However, the built kernel can be successfully started by using QEMU, so the problem is basically locked in the factors related to the development board.We mainly suspect that there may be a problem with the correspondence between the kernel driver and the device tree, and the most suspicious is the serial port driver. After re analyzing the boot log, we found the following output: ```shell [ 0.674296] Serial: 8250/16550 driver, 4 ports, IRQ sharing disabled ``` This output can prove that the serial driver is properly loaded by the kernel. And the following output: ```shell [ 11.098262] platform ffe7014000.serial: deferred probe pending ``` Basically declared the real cause of the problem: the loading of the serial device failed. The Linux kernel driver uses the platform device driver model, where the driver and device are loaded into the kernel separately and then matched. Therefore, it is possible that the driver is successfully loaded, but the serial port fails to load. The reason for deferred probe pending may be that the driver that the device depends on has not been properly loaded by the kernel. Then analyze the serial port related part in the device tree file: ```shell uart0: serial@ffe7014000 { /* Normal serial, for C910 log */ compatible \"snps,dw apb uart\"; …… interrupt parent <&intc>; …… clocks <&clk CLKGEN_UART0_SCLK>; …… }; intc: interrupt controller@ffd8000000 { compatible \"riscv,plic0\"; …… }; clk: clock controller@ffef010000 { compatible \"thead,light fm ree clk\"; …… }; ``` Find out if there is a missing driver in the kernel by searching for the value of the compatible attribute in the code repository. The serial port uses the driver: \"snps, dw apb uart\" The serial port dependent interrupt controller intc uses the driver: \"riscv, PLIC0\" The serial port dependent clock clk uses the driver: \"thead, light fm ree clk\" Through the search found that the serial port dependent clock clk uses the driver \"thead, light fm ree clk\" missing. After the relevant drivers were transplanted from the kernel provided by Sipeed to Linux v6.5 rc1, it finally started normally. ##### Solution 1. Find the drivers/clk/thead folder in the kernel provided by Sipeed and add it to the drivers/clk folder of Linux v6.5 rc1 2. Modify the Kconfig file in the thead folder: replace all SOC_THEAD with ARCH_THEAD 3. Modify the Kconfig and Makefile files under drivers/clk to include the thead folder 4. Find the include/dt bindings/clock folder in the kernel provided by Sipeed and add the following header files to the same folder of Linux v6.5 rc1: light dspsys.h light fm ap clock.h light mpw clock.h light visys.h light vosys.h light vpsys.h 5. Modify the Linux v6.5 rc1 arch/riscv/configs/defconfig file to add ```shell CONFIG_THEAD_CLK y CONFIG_CLK_LIGHT_FM y ``` After the driver transplantation is completed, the kernel can be recompiled and burned to the development board for normal startup. ## Reference [Build Linux v6.5 rc1 for LicheePi 4A](https://tinylab.org/licheepi4a linux/) [How to troubleshoot deferred probe issues in Linux](https://blog.dowhile0.org/2022/06/21/how to troubleshoot deferred probe issues in linux/) [[PATCH v3 0/8] Add Sipeed Lichee Pi 4A RISC V board support](https://lore.kernel.org/linux riscv/20230617161529.2092 1 jszhang@kernel.org/) [Burn image](https://wiki.sipeed.com/hardware/en/lichee/th1520/lpi4a/4_burn_image.html)"},"/hardware/en/lichee/th1520/lpi4a/9_benchmark.html":{"title":"CPU Benchmarks","content":" title: CPU Benchmarks keywords: Linux, Lichee, TH1520, SBC, RISCV, benchmark update: date: 2023 07 21 version: v1.1 author: ztd content: Release English docs date: 2023 05 08 version: v1.0 author: wonder content: Release docs ## Dhrystone The official data from Flathead, C910 is around 5.6 out of 10. ![dmips](./../../../../zh/lichee/th1520/lpi4a/assets/benchmark/dmips.png) ## CoreMarks Test parameter configuration: ` funroll all loops finline limit 500 fgcse sm fno schedule insns msignedness cmpiv fno code hoisting mno thread jumps1 mno iv adjust addr cost mno expand split imm` Test results (1.85GHz) using the public toolchain, GCC version `13.1.0`: ```txt 2K performance run parameters for coremark.

Turn on the host, press and hold the power button in the upper right corner for 3 seconds to turn it on (release it when you see the screen backlight lights up) ![unbox4](./assets/lcon4a/unbox4.png) If the backlight never lights up, the battery may be exhausted during transportation. You can try plugging in the power adapter and long pressing the power button to turn it on. After the backlight turns on for about 10 seconds, the screen will display the Linux penguin icon and the boot log (early image versions are displayed vertically at this stage) After the log is printed for about 20 seconds, the Debian desktop system starts to be entered. After entering the desktop system, you can test whether the screen touch, pointing stick, and keyboard are working. If you find that they are not working, you can contact customer service. The default system is Debian, which is pre installed with Chrome, VSCode, Office, KiCAD, KODI, Parole and other application software, you can experience them one by one. You can use sudo apt instal xxx to install the software. The default username and password are sipeed, licheepi For other general software usage, please refer to the relevant documentation chapters of LicheePi4A. ### SSD Installation Guide Console supports M.2 2242 SATA interface SSD, which can be installed after removing the SSD cover on the rear case. ![ssd1](./assets/lcon4a/ssd1.jpg) ### SOM Installation Guide If you choose the barebone package, you need to install the SOM module. You need to bring your own hexagonal screwdriver, remove the back cover, install the SOM module, install silicone grease above the CPU/DDR, place the heat pipe, place a long silicone grease sheet on the heat pipe, and reinstall the back cover. For detailed installation, please see the pictures in the following chapters. ## system The Console image is released together with the LicheePi4A image. The default is the Full image. It is recommended to use SOM with 8+32 and above configuration. If you use an 8+8 SOM, you need to tailor the file system yourself. download link: Baidu Netdisk: [Click me](https://pan.baidu.com/s/1xH56ZlewB6UOMlke5BrKWQ) Mega cloud disk: [Click me](https://mega.nz/folder/phoQlBTZ#cZeQ3qZ__pDvP94PT3_bGA) Common application displays: ![sys1](./assets/lcon4a/sys1.png) The Console system architecture is as follows. For details, please refer to the schematic diagram or device tree file. ![sys2](./assets/lcon4a/sys2.png) ## Power consumption ### Power Supply The maximum power consumption of the Console is about 11W, and about 7~8W when no load is used. It can be powered by 12V DC 3.5mm interface or 5V USB C port. ### Battery Life For the sake of Console battery life and heat generation, the current upper limit of the CPU frequency of the default image is limited to 1.5GHz. At this main frequency, the measured usage time is 2 to 3 hours. (stress ng stress test lasts for 2 hours, with the screen on and no load for 3 hours). The default screen brightness is 50%. If you need to extend the battery life, you can reduce the screen brightness: ``` sudo i cd /sys/class/backlight/pwm backlight@0 echo xxx > brightness # xxx is brightness you want, 0~100 ``` Power consumption composition (300MHz no load bright screen, 50% brightness) ![heat1](./assets/lcon4a/power1.png) ### Heat Dissipation Console uses a 3cm turbo fan + 10cm heat pipe to dissipate heat from the CPU. One end of the heat pipe is attached to the CPU, and the other end is dissipated by a turbo fan. The top surface uses thermal conductive silicone grease to contact the bottom case for heat dissipation. ![heat1](./assets/lcon4a/heat1.png) ![heat1](./assets/lcon4a/heat2.png) Under continuous high load work (such as browser video soft decoding), the CPU temperature can eventually reach 60 to 65 degrees, and the bottom case temperature can reach a maximum of about 50 degrees. ![heat1](./assets/lcon4a/heat3.png) If you have better cooling suggestions, you can send an email to support@sipeed.com > At present (2023.11), the browser hardware decoding has not yet been adapted, so it will occupy a lot of CPU when watching browser videos. It is expected that the browser hardware decoding function will be incorporated in December. ### Standby The hardware circuit design of the Console takes the standby situation into consideration and adds power control to each relevant peripheral. However, currently (2023.11) the low power consumption function of TH1520 has not been added to the SDK, so the standby function still needs to be updated. ### Shutdown The current shutdown power consumption of the Console is about 1.3mA, which can support the shutdown time for about 3 months. ## Download [Sipeed Download Station](https://dl.sipeed.com/shareURL/LICHEE/LicheeConsole4A) ## Other links [Taobao] [Aliexpress](https://www.aliexpress.us/item/3256805987954160.html) QQ group: 559614960 [Click me to automatically join the group](http://qm.qq.com/cgi bin/qm/qr?k 5YkapIhdtWHp8AEfM5_bFFYQIX3CUQN6) Telegram: https://t.me/linux4rv Forum: Maixhub.com/discussion Contact email: support@sipeed.com"},"/hardware/en/lichee/th1520/lcon4a/setup_guide.html":{"title":"setup—guide","content":" title: setup—guide keywords: Lichee, TH1520, Console, RISCV, update: date: 2023 12 19 version: v1.0 author: sinky content: Release docs For customers who purchased Package A, the following accessories are included.

But we can't flash this image file with PhoenixCard application, so here are steps. After booting this system on LicheeRV, we can use mouse and keyboard to operate this system if connecting this board with HDMI screen, otherwise we can only operate this system by serial communication. ## Ubuntu Introduction Ubuntu is based on another linux distribution Debian, and we can find many answers from internet when meet trouble, which is friendly to beginners and helps them find solutions quickly when they have trouble. Because of the limited performance, it's suggested running this system by command edition. If you need graphical interface, you need to do it by yourself. <img src \"./../../../zh/lichee/assets/RV/ubuntu/d1_ubuntu_desktop.jpg\" alt \"d1_ubuntu_desktop\" width \"45%\"> <img src \"./../../../zh/lichee/assets/RV/ubuntu/d1_ubuntu_desktop_picture.jpg\" alt \"d1_ubuntu_desktop_picture\" width \"45%\"> The photo above is D1 Dock Pro，and it's different with Dock board, Dock Pro board incorporates USB uart port, by which we can communicate the board card with the computer with only one USB TypeC cable. The relevant peripherals can be seen in the following figure. <img src \"./../../../zh/lichee/assets/RV/ubuntu/dock_pro_top_block.jpg\" alt \"dock_pro_top_block\" width \"45%\"> <img src \"./../../../zh/lichee/assets/RV/ubuntu/dock_pro_bottom_block.jpg\" alt \"dock_pro_bottom_block\" width \"45%\"> This board can be bought from [aliexpress](https://www.aliexpress.com/item/1005003741287162.html?). ## Steps ### Get image We upload this image file on [mega](https://mega.nz/folder/1FxlVKrA#nONEKgZWKBzeEkWKAq_AcQ). ### Software Visit [balenaEtcher](https://www.balena.io/etcher/) to download application. We have upload Windows edition software in our [Download station](https://dl.sipeed.com/shareURL/others/balenaEtcher), other edition can be downloaded from [balenaEtcher official site](https://www.balena.io/etcher/). ### Flash System Prepare a SD card over 8G, the card with better performance can have better experience. Connect the TF card with computer by SD card reader or SD card slot in the computer. Here is an example about SD card slot in computer, if your computer dose not have SD card slot, you need the SD card reader. <table> <tr> <th colspan \"2\"> Connect TF card with computer </th> </th> </tr> <tr> <td>Connect by SD card reader</td> <td>Connect by SD card slot</td> </tr> <tr> <td><img src \"./../../../zh/lichee/assets/RV/ubuntu/d1_ubuntu_sdcard_reader.jpg\" alt \"d1_ubuntu_sdcard_reader\" ></td> <td><img src \"./../../../zh/lichee/assets/RV/ubuntu/d1_ubuntu_sdcard_computer_reader.jpg\" alt \"d1_ubuntu_sdcard_computer_reader\" ></td> </tr> </table> Run balenaEtcher, choose the downloaded image file, choose your TF card, click Flash: ![d1_ubuntu_burn_image](./../../../zh/lichee/assets/RV/ubuntu/d1_ubuntu_burn_image.gif) Make sure you choose the correct SD card. ![d1_ubuntu_burn_image_sdcard_choose](./../../../zh/lichee/assets/RV/ubuntu/d1_ubuntu_burn_image_sdcard_choose.png) This will take a bit time, and after finishing this work it will be like as following figure. If there is no `Successful` shown after finishing this work, try to reburn this image. ![d1_ubuntu_finish_burn_image](./../../../zh/lichee/assets/RV/ubuntu/d1_ubuntu_finish_burn_image.png) ## Run System Finishing flashing system and seeing `successful` shown in the end, we can connect SD card with this board to start ubuntu. ![dock_pro_ubuntu](./../../../zh/lichee/assets/RV/ubuntu/dock_pro_ubuntu.jpg) View messages from UART, and we can operate this board by UART. <img src \"./../../../zh/lichee/assets/RV/ubuntu/d1_ubuntu_boot_opensbi.jpg\" alt \"d1_ubuntu_boot_opensbi\" width \"45%\"> <img src \"./../../../zh/lichee/assets/RV/ubuntu/ubuntu_boot.jpg\" alt \"ubuntu_boot\" width \"45%\"> Wait a while, then the username and password are both `root`. ![d1_ubuntu_login](./../../../zh/lichee/assets/RV/ubuntu/d1_ubuntu_login.jpg) ## Connect wifi Use command `nmcli` to connect 2.4G wireless. Scan wifi ```bash nmcli dev wifi ``` ![d1_ubuntu_wifi_scan](./../../../zh/lichee/assets/RV/ubuntu/d1_ubuntu_wifi_scan.jpg) Connect wifi，by command `nmcli dev wifi connect wifi_name password wifi_password` ```bash nmcli dev wifi connect Sipeed_Guest password 12345678 ``` ![d1_ubuntu_wifi_connect](./../../../zh/lichee/assets/RV/ubuntu/d1_ubuntu_wifi_connect.jpg) See `successfully`, then we have already connected to the wifi, and commands like `apt` and others work fine. ![d1_ubuntu_install_tree](./../../../zh/lichee/assets/RV/ubuntu/d1_ubuntu_install_tree.jpg) ## Blink led We can blink led on our board by this Ubuntu system like what we have done on Tina, here are the codes: Tuen on LED : ```bash echo 1 > /sys/class/leds/\\:status/brightness ``` Note the `\\` in this command, without which you can't run this command successfully. ![d1_ubuntu_led_on](./../../../zh/lichee/assets/RV/ubuntu/d1_ubuntu_led_on.jpg) Turn off LED : ```bash echo 0 > /sys/class/leds/\\:status/brightness ``` ![d1_ubuntu_led_off](./../../../zh/lichee/assets/RV/ubuntu/d1_ubuntu_led_off.jpg) ## In the end Based in [Ubuntu LicheeRV image](https://wiki.ubuntu.com/RISC V/LicheeRV), we packed the wireless driver inside, which make user more convenient to experience this system. ## Questions ### No HDMI output The board will not display HDMI command line when booting, and after the HDMI related service starts LicheeRV displays the command line console on HDMI screen, and some screen is not fit LicheeRV ubuntu image output and will not display the command line console. Here is the login photo of UART (ttyS0) and HDMI command line console (tty1) of LicheeRV ubuntu image. ![d1_ubuntu_console_hdmi](./../../../zh/lichee/assets/RV/ubuntu/d1_ubuntu_console_hdmi.jpg)"},"/hardware/en/lichee/RV/user.html":{"title":"Basic usage","content":"# Basic usage ## Use Dock motherboard ### Connect Board We can easily note the TX and RX pins marked on the bottom of motherboard, so we can use serial port of the ttl level wo communicate with computer(Both Tina and Debian os are OK). For Tina OS we can use typeC cable to connect the core board with computer and use adb shell to communicate. For Debian OS we can use keyboard and mouse to control the system. #### Notes about Debian It may run slow because of the speed of TF card. The users name is `root` and password is `licheepi` **When using serial port connection board it always print kernel message, do following steps to stop it:** Edit `/etc/rsyslog.conf` by root and change `*.emerg` located in lht last line into `#*.emerg` in this file Restart rsyslog service by this command `/etc/init.d/rsyslog restart` **Want to use terminal in GUI** Use command `Alt+F2` to run \"run\", then input `termit` to open a terminal. ### Light LED After succeed login OS(Both Tina and Debian are OK), we can stat blink LED. There is an LED beside the screw fixing pad on the core board, This can be found in the dimension drawing: <details> <summary><font color \"#4F84FF\">Click to see dimension drawing</font></summary> <img src \"./../../../zh/lichee/assets/RV/rv_coreboard_dimension.png\"> </details> And from the [schematic](https://dl.sipeed.com/shareURL/LICHEE/D1/Lichee_RV/HDK/2_Schematic) we can know the led connects with PC0 pin, and we can figure out its siginal number is ('C' 'A')x32+0 2x32+0 64 We can also know the IO multiplexing table from pinmux pins file ```bash cat /sys/kernel/debug/pinctrl/2000000.pinctrl/pinmux pins ... pin 64 (PC0): device 2008000.ledc function ledc group PC0 #From this we know it connects with LED pin 65 (PC1): UNCLAIMED pin 66 (PC2): UNCLAIMED pin 67 (PC3): UNCLAIMED pin 68 (PC4): UNCLAIMED pin 69 (PC5): UNCLAIMED pin 70 (PC6): UNCLAIMED pin 71 (PC7): UNCLAIMED ... ``` We export this led GPIO first： ```bash echo 64 > /sys/class/gpio/export #export GPIO64 ``` Then we set this IO direction out, by which we can control its voltage level. ```bash echo out>/sys/class/gpio/gpio64/direction #Set IO direction out echo 1 > /sys/class/gpio/gpio64/value #Set IO high voltage level echo 0 > /sys/class/gpio/gpio64/value #Set IO low voltage level ``` This is the easiest way to control IO. We should cancel export if we don't use this IO. ```bash echo 64 > /sys/class/gpio/unexport # cancel export GPIO64 ``` Up to now we have succeeded Lighting led on RISC V 64 D1. You can also light on the serial RGB LED ws2812: ```bash echo 255 > /sys/class/leds/sunxi_led0r/brightness #Red led on echo 0 > /sys/class/leds/sunxi_led0r/brightness #Red led off echo 255 > /sys/class/leds/sunxi_led0g/brightness #Green led on echo 0 > /sys/class/leds/sunxi_led0g/brightness #Green led off echo 255 > /sys/class/leds/sunxi_led0b/brightness #Blue led on echo 0 > /sys/class/leds/sunxi_led0b/brightness #Blue led off ``` ### Peripheral verification #### Audio function Check recording device Use command `arecord l` ```bash root@MaixLinux:~# arecord l **** List of CAPTURE Hardware Devices **** card 0: audiocodec [audiocodec], device 0: SUNXI CODEC 2030000.codec 0 [] Subdevices: 1/1 Subdevice 0: subdevice 0 card 1: snddmic [snddmic], device 0: 2031000.dmic dmic hifi dmic hifi 0 [] Subdevices: 1/1 Subdevice 0: subdevice 0 card 2: sndhdmi [sndhdmi], device 0: 2034000.daudio audiohdmi dai 20340a4.hdmiaudio 0 [] Subdevices: 1/1 Subdevice 0: subdevice 0 ``` Check speaker device Use command `aplay l` ``` root@MaixLinux:~# aplay l **** List of PLAYBACK Hardware Devices **** card 0: audiocodec [audiocodec], device 0: SUNXI CODEC 2030000.codec 0 [] Subdevices: 1/1 Subdevice 0: subdevice 0 card 2: sndhdmi [sndhdmi], device 0: 2034000.daudio audiohdmi dai 20340a4.hdmiaudio 0 [] Subdevices: 1/1 Subdevice 0: subdevice 0 ``` Play recording： ```bash arecord D hw:1,0 f S16_LE t wav d 3 t.wav #Recording ``` ```bash aplay D hw:0,0 t.wav #Play recording ``` Besides, we can adjust volume by alsamixer application <details> <summary><font color \"#4F84FF\">Click to see alsamixer</font></summary> <pre><code class \"language shell\">┌────────────────────────────── AlsaMixer v1.2.4 ──────────────────────────────┐ │ Card: audiocodec F1: Help │ │ Chip: F2: System information │ │ View: F3:[Playback] F4: Capture F5: All F6: Select sound card │ │ Item: Headphone [dB gain: 24.00] Esc: Exit │ │ │ │ ┌──┐ ┌──┐ │ │ │ │ │ │ │ │ │ │ │ │ │ │ │ │ │ │ → │ │ │ │ │ → │ │ │ │▒▒│ → │ │ │ │▒▒│ → │ │ │ │▒▒│ → │ │ │ │▒▒│ → │ │▒▒│ │▒▒│ → │ │▒▒│ │▒▒│ │ │ │▒▒│ │▒▒│ │ │ ├──┤ ┌──┐ ┌──┐ Off ┌──┐ ┌──┐ ┌──┐ └──┘ │ │ │MM│ │MM│ │MM│ │MM│ │MM│ │MM│ │ │ └──┘ └──┘ └──┘ └──┘ └──┘ └──┘ │ │ 25 63 │ │ &lt;Headphon>FMINL ga FMINR ga ADC1 ADC ADC1 Inp ADC1 Inp ADC1 Inp ADC1 vol │ └──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘</code></pre> </details> #### USB Function Default kernel incorporates driver for external USB flash disk.

The main difference is that RGB LCD display protocol transfers by digital signal while VGA protocol transfers by analog signal. Here we introduce VGA timing. ![](./../../../../zh/tang/assets/examples/lcd_pjt_1.png) There shows horizon synchronization timing and vertical synchronization timing in the picture above. From the timing picture, we know both display a horizon of data or display a vertical of data, data transfers during the two synchronization signal pulses. Each horizon of data contains back porch, visible data **(this is normally thought as active data)** and front porch. The visible data is resolution we normally think, while the parameter of back porch and front porch depends on the resolution and frame rate. Its typical parameters can be found at <http://www.tinyvga.com/vga timing>. The timing of this 5 inch screen we sell is a bit different, its parameters can be downloaded [here (PDF)](https://dl.sipeed.com/fileList/TANG/Nano%209K/6_Chip_Manual/EN/LCD_Datasheet/5.0inch_LCD_Datashet%20_RGB_.pdf). For other size screen parameters, they can be downloaded [here](https://dl.sipeed.com/TANG/Nano%209K/6_Chip_Manual/EN/LCD_Datasheet/). The following picture shows the screenshot about this LCD timing. ![](./../../../../zh/tang/assets/examples/lcd_pjt_2.png) ![](./../../../../zh/tang/assets/examples/lcd_pjt_3.png) The first picture form shows parameters of the screen and the the following picture is its timing. From its timing picture, we can know we don't need to set front porch time and back porch time, we just need to set blanking time. ## Create project Please refer to this [article](./../led/led.html) to see how to create project. ## Generate screen clock Here we use gowin official IP The crystal oscillator onboard is 27MHz, but our screen needs 33.3MHZ clock, so we need to use the corresponding ip core to generate the corresponding clock. Here we use `IP Core Generate` which can be find in *Tools > IP Core Generate*. ![](./../../../../zh/tang/Tang Nano 1K/assets/Gowin_IP_rpll.png) Double click `rPLL` and select `Verilog` in the pop up window language, set CLKIN 27MHz, CLKOUT to 33.00MHz. Also config the tolerance. ![](./../../../../zh/tang/Tang Nano 1K/assets/lcd_rpll.png) After clicking OK it asks whether to add it to the current project choose `yes`. ![](./../../../../zh/tang/Tang Nano 1K/examples/led/assets/add_ip_file_in_project.png) Then a tmp file will appear, we can use it to generate the ip, like what is shown below. ![](./../../../../zh/tang/Tang Nano/examples/led/assets/ip_examples.png) ## Screen driver **To start this we should create a verilog file first** ### Port definition First define ports which are needed to drive screen ```verilog module VGAMod ( input CLK, input nRST, input PixelClk, output LCD_DE, output LCD_HSYNC, output LCD_VSYNC, \toutput [4:0] LCD_B, \toutput [5:0] LCD_G, \toutput [4:0] LCD_R ); ``` We use RGB565 driver mode. ### Timing constants Then we define the constants according to the timing form picture ```verilog localparam V_BackPorch 16'd6; //0 or 45 localparam V_Pluse \t 16'd5; localparam HightPixel 16'd480; localparam V_FrontPorch 16'd62; //45 or 0 localparam H_BackPorch 16'd182; \t localparam H_Pluse \t 16'd1; localparam WidthPixel 16'd800; localparam H_FrontPorch 16'd210; localparam PixelForHS WidthPixel + H_BackPorch + H_FrontPorch; \t localparam LineForVS HightPixel + V_BackPorch + V_FrontPorch; ``` First we define front porch, back porch and valid pixel data. As for the front porch timing and back porch timing which have been mentioned earlier, it can be combined into an erasing time, that is, one can be set to 0, and the other can be set to the erasing time. Anyway, the front porch timing and back porch timing can be added up to meet the timing requirements in the table is ok. ### Define variables Define some variables helps us to meet timing requirement ```verilog reg [15:0] LineCount; reg [15:0] PixelCount; reg\t[9:0] Data_R; reg\t[9:0] Data_G; reg\t[9:0] Data_B; ``` ### Synchronization signals This code generates synchronization signals. It should be noted that the synchronization signals of this screen enabled by negative polarity. ```verilog always @( posedge PixelClk or negedge nRST )begin if( !nRST ) begin LineCount < 16'b0; PixelCount < 16'b0; end else if( PixelCount PixelForHS ) begin PixelCount < 16'b0; LineCount < LineCount + 1'b1; end else if( LineCount LineForVS ) begin LineCount < 16'b0; PixelCount < 16'b0; end else PixelCount < PixelCount + 1'b1; end always @( posedge PixelClk or negedge nRST )begin if( !nRST ) begin \t\t\tData_R < 9'b0; \t\t\tData_G < 9'b0; \t\t\tData_B < 9'b0; end else begin \t\t\tend \tend //Here note the negative polarity of HSYNC and VSYNC assign LCD_HSYNC (( PixelCount > H_Pluse)&&( PixelCount < (PixelForHS H_FrontPorch))) ? 1'b0 : 1'b1; assign LCD_VSYNC ((( LineCount > V_Pluse )&&( LineCount < (LineForVS 0) )) ) ? 1'b0 : 1'b1; ``` ### Enable signal This code decides whether display image. This driver needs a port which is set to 1 when the 800*480 data of the image is valid to enable display. ```verilog assign LCD_DE ( ( PixelCount > H_BackPorch )&& ( PixelCount < PixelForHS H_FrontPorch ) && ( LineCount > V_BackPorch ) && ( LineCount < LineForVS V_FrontPorch 1 )) ? 1'b1 : 1'b0; //It will shake if there not minus one ``` ### Test color bars This code generate color bars to test LCD ```verilog localparam Colorbar_width WidthPixel / 16; assign LCD_R ( PixelCount < ( H_BackPorch + Colorbar_width * 0 )) ? 5'b00000 : ( PixelCount < ( H_BackPorch + Colorbar_width * 1 )) ? 5'b00001 : ( PixelCount < ( H_BackPorch + Colorbar_width * 2 )) ? 5'b00010 : ( PixelCount < ( H_BackPorch + Colorbar_width * 3 )) ? 5'b00100 : ( PixelCount < ( H_BackPorch + Colorbar_width * 4 )) ? 5'b01000 : ( PixelCount < ( H_BackPorch + Colorbar_width * 5 )) ? 5'b10000 : 5'b00000; assign LCD_G ( PixelCount < ( H_BackPorch + Colorbar_width * 6 )) ? 6'b000001: ( PixelCount < ( H_BackPorch + Colorbar_width * 7 )) ? 6'b000010: ( PixelCount < ( H_BackPorch + Colorbar_width * 8 )) ? 6'b000100: ( PixelCount < ( H_BackPorch + Colorbar_width * 9 )) ? 6'b001000: ( PixelCount < ( H_BackPorch + Colorbar_width * 10 )) ? 6'b010000: ( PixelCount < ( H_BackPorch + Colorbar_width * 11 )) ? 6'b100000: 6'b000000; assign LCD_B ( PixelCount < ( H_BackPorch + Colorbar_width * 12 )) ? 5'b00001 : ( PixelCount < ( H_BackPorch + Colorbar_width * 13 )) ? 5'b00010 : ( PixelCount < ( H_BackPorch + Colorbar_width * 14 )) ? 5'b00100 : ( PixelCount < ( H_BackPorch + Colorbar_width * 15 )) ? 5'b01000 : ( PixelCount < ( H_BackPorch + Colorbar_width * 16 )) ? 5'b10000 : 5'b00000; ``` **Do not forget to add `endmodule` in the end of the driver file.** Up to now we have finished the driver module. ## Instantiated in the top **Create a new verilog file** Just copy the content below and save it. ```verilog module TOP //Name TOP module ( \tinput\t\t\tnRST, \tinput XTAL_IN, \toutput\t\t\tLCD_CLK, \toutput\t\t\tLCD_HYNC, \toutput\t\t\tLCD_SYNC, \toutput\t\t\tLCD_DEN, \toutput\t[4:0]\tLCD_R, \toutput\t[5:0]\tLCD_G, \toutput\t[4:0]\tLCD_B ); // list ports \twire\t\tCLK_SYS;\t \twire\t\tCLK_PIX; //instantiate pll Gowin_rPLL chip_pll( .clkout(CLK_SYS), //output clkout //200M .clkoutd(CLK_PIX), //output clkoutd //33.00M .clkin(XTAL_IN) //input clkin );\t \tVGAMod\tVGAMod_inst //instantiate vga driver \t( \t\t.CLK\t\t(\tCLK_SYS ), \t\t.nRST\t\t(\tnRST\t\t), \t\t.PixelClk\t(\tCLK_PIX\t\t), \t\t.LCD_DE\t\t(\tLCD_DEN\t \t), \t\t.LCD_HSYNC\t(\tLCD_HYNC \t), \t\t.LCD_VSYNC\t(\tLCD_SYNC \t), \t\t.LCD_B\t\t(\tLCD_B\t\t), \t\t.LCD_G\t\t(\tLCD_G\t\t), \t\t.LCD_R\t\t(\tLCD_R\t\t) \t); \tassign\t\tLCD_CLK\t\t \tCLK_PIX; endmodule ``` ## Synthesize, constrain, Place&Route ### Synthesize After finishing steps above, go to the \"Process\" interface, synthesize the edited file, which means running \"Synthesize\". ![](./../../../../zh/tang/Tang Nano 9K/nano_9k/nano_9k_synthsize.png) If the result is the same as shown below ![](./../../../../zh/tang/Tang Nano/assets/LED.png) It means that there is no bug in our code, we can continue the next steps.

You can also leave a message below. 2. **Troubleshooting**: If you encounter any issues, consult our [Tang Questions](https://wiki.sipeed.com/hardware/en/tang/common doc/questions.html) page first. 3. **Avoid using JTAG, MODE0/1, and DONE pins unless necessary**. For details, refer to [SUG100 2.6E_Gowin Software User Guide.pdf](https://dl.sipeed.com/fileList/TANG/Nano%209K/6_Chip_Manual/EN/General%20Guide/SUG100 2.6E_Gowin%20Software%20User%20Guide.pdf). 4. **Static Electricity Precautions**: Always discharge static electricity before handling the PCBA to prevent damage. 5. **GPIO Voltage Compliance**: Ensure that the actual working voltage of GPIOs does not exceed their rated value as indicated in the schematic. Exceeding these limits can cause permanent damage to the PCBA. 6. **FPC Cable Connection**: When connecting FPC flexible cables, ensure that the cable is fully inserted into its base without any offset. 7. **Avoid Short Circuits**: Prevent liquids or metals from coming into contact with the component pads on the PCBA while it's operating, as this could cause a short circuit and damage the PCBA. 8. **Handling Multiplexed IO and HDMI Ports**: Be aware that the HDMI IO ports are pulled up. When using IOs routed to pin headers, they may not operate as intended. ![HDMI IO Port Configuration](./../../../zh/tang/Tang Nano 9K/assets/nano_9k_hdmi_io.png)"},"/hardware/en/tang/tang-nano-20k/nano-20k.html":{"title":"Tang Nano 20K","content":" title: Tang Nano 20K keywords: FPGA, Tang, Nano, 20K update: date: 2023 02 27 version: v0.1 author: wonder content: Create file ## Introduction Tang Nano 20K is a development board, using the [GW2AR 18 QN88](http://www.gowinsemi.com.cn/prod_view.aspx?TypeId 10&FId t3:10:3&Id 167#GW2AR) FPGA, containing 20736 LUT4 logic cells and 15552 Flip Flops.

Power on Tang Nano 20K, leds flow. ![unbox_nano_20k_led_water_flow](./../../../../zh/tang/tang nano 20k/assets/unbox/unbox_nano_20k_led_water_flow.gif) Windows 10 and Windows 11 can install the driver automatically, and there is at least one USB Serial Port in the device manager. We can open this serial port via the serial port available application like [Mobaxterm](https://mobaxterm.mobatek.net/). ![unbox_device_manager_serial_port](./../../../../zh/tang/tang nano 20k/assets/unbox/unbox_device_manager_serial_port.png) Set baudrate 115200, open the serial port, and we succeed opening the litex terminal. ![unbox_uart_litex_terminal](./../../../../zh/tang/tang nano 20k/assets/unbox/unbox_uart_litex_terminal.png) Tap the `tab` on your serial terminal via keyboard to see all commands we can use. ![unbox_uart_litex_command_list](./../../../../zh/tang/tang nano 20k/assets/unbox/unbox_uart_litex_command_list.png) Here we take leds as example, type `leds` command. ![unbox_uart_litex_leds_command_help](./../../../../zh/tang/tang nano 20k/assets/unbox/unbox_uart_litex_leds_command_help.png) We can see it requires a value with `leds` command.

The basic unit in Verilog is module. A module is composed of two parts: one describes the interface, and the other describes the internal logic function, that is, defines how the input affects the output. A module is like this: ```v module module_name #(parameter) (port) ; function endmodule ``` The module starts from module and ends by endmodule. The module is followed by the module name (module_name), transitable variable parameters (parameter), port and direction declaration (port), followed by internal logic function description (function), and finally, endmodule is used to represent this module. The internal logic function is usually composed by the assign and always blocks; The assign statement describes logical circuit, and the always block is used to describe timing circuit. ### Blocking and Non blocking assignments In timing logic, there are two assignment symbols: ` ` and `< `. Note that `< ` means less than or equal to in the if statement, and is not an assignment symbol in the if statement. Visit the [difference between Blocking and Non blocking assignments](#difference between blocking and non blocking assignments) ### Think storm Before coding, we need to think our purpose: The led flashes every 0.5S. Then we draw a demand block diagram as follows: ![block_method](./../../tang primer 20k/examples/lite/assets/block_method.png) Then we need a counter to time of every 0.5S, LED flashes means IO flip. ![count_block](./../../tang primer 20k/examples/lite/assets/time_count.png) Put the thought diagram into practical use, then it will look like this: ![clock_time_count](./../../tang primer 20k/examples/lite/assets/clock_time_count.png) The Clock is the clock source, providing the accurate time for the time counter. ### Code description From the verilog introduction and think storm diagram above, we can see the module we will create contains 2 ports: ```v module led( input Clock, output IO_voltage ); endmodule ``` For time counter inside module, crystal oscillator on the Primer 20K core board is 27MHZ, so we have 27 million times rising edges per second, and we just need to count 13500000 times rising edges to get 0.5 seconds. The counter starts from `0`, and to count 13500000 times rising edges, we count to 13499999. When counted to 0.5S, we set a flag to inform LED IO to flip its voltage. The overall count code is as follows: ```v //parameter Clock_frequency 27_000_000; // Crystal oscillator frequency is 27Mhz parameter count_value 13_499_999; // The number of times needed to time 0.5S reg [23:0] count_value_reg ; // counter_value reg count_value_flag; // IO chaneg flag always @(posedge Clock) begin if ( count_value_reg < count_value ) begin //not count to 0.5S count_value_reg < count_value_reg + 1'b1; // Continue counting count_value_flag < 1'b0 ; // No flip flag end else begin //Count to 0.5S count_value_reg < 23'b0; // Clear counter,prepare for next time counting. count_value_flag < 1'b1 ; // Flip flag end end ``` The code to change IO voltage are as follows: ```v reg IO_voltage_reg 1'b0; // Initial state always @(posedge Clock) begin if ( count_value_flag ) // Flip flag IO_voltage_reg < ~IO_voltage_reg; // IO voltage flip else // No flip flag IO_voltage_reg < IO_voltage_reg; // IO voltage constant end ``` Combined with the codes above, it goes like this: ```v module led( input Clock, output IO_voltage ); /********** Counter **********/ //parameter Clock_frequency 27_000_000; // Crystal oscillator frequency is 27Mhz parameter count_value 13_499_999; // The number of times needed to time 0.5S reg [23:0] count_value_reg ; // counter_value reg count_value_flag; // IO change flag always @(posedge Clock) begin if ( count_value_reg < count_value ) begin //not count to 0.5S count_value_reg < count_value_reg + 1'b1; // Continue counting count_value_flag < 1'b0 ; // No flip flag end else begin //Count to 0.5S count_value_reg < 23'b0; // Clear counter,prepare for next time counting. count_value_flag < 1'b1 ; // Flip flag end end /********** IO voltage flip **********/ reg IO_voltage_reg 1'b0; // Initial state always @(posedge Clock) begin if ( count_value_flag ) // Flip flag IO_voltage_reg < ~IO_voltage_reg; // IO voltage flip else // No flip flag IO_voltage_reg < IO_voltage_reg; // IO voltage constant end /***** Add an extra line of code *****/ assign IO_voltage IO_voltage_reg; endmodule ``` Because the `IO_voltage` is declared in the port position, which is wire type by default. To connect it to the reg variable `IO_voltage_reg`, we need to use assign. ## Synthesize, constrain, place&route ### Synthesize After finishing the code, go to the \"Process\" interface and double click \"Synthesize\" to synthesize our code to convert the verilog code content to netlist. ![Synthesize](./../../../../../../news/others/20k_lite_start/assets/synthesize.png) ### Constraint After Synthesizing our code, we need to set constrains to bind the ports defined in our code to fpga pins, by which we can realize our module function on fpga. Click the FloorPlanner in the top of Synthesize to set constrains. ![floorplanner](./../../../../zh/tang/tang primer 20k/examples/assets/led_assets/floorplanner.png) Since this is the first time we create it, the following dialog box will pop up. Click OK and the graphical constraint interface will pop up. ![create_constrain_file](./../../../../zh/tang/tang primer 20k/examples/assets/led_assets/create_constrain_file.png) ![floorplanner_interface](./../../../../zh/tang/tang nano 20k/assets/led/nano_20k_floorplanner_interface.png) The ways to constraint the file can be get from this docs: [SUG935 1.3E_Gowin Design Physical Constraints User Guide.pdf](https://dl.sipeed.com/fileList/TANG/Nano%209K/6_Chip_Manual/EN/General%20Guide/SUG935 1.3E_Gowin%20Design%20Physical%20Constraints%20User%20Guide.pdf) Here we only use the IO Constrains method shown below to constrain the pins: ![floor_planner_ioconstrain](./../../../../zh/tang/tang primer 20k/examples/assets/led_assets/floor_planner_ioconstrain.png) According to [Schematic of core board](https://dl.sipeed.com/fileList/TANG/Primer_20K/02_Schematic/), we can know the input pin of crystal oscillator is PIN04。 <img src \"./../../../../zh/tang/tang nano 20k/assets/led/nano_20k_crystal_port.png\" alt \"nano_20k_crystal_port\" width 45%> Here we only blink LED0, and we can see it's connected with FPGA PIN15. ![nano_20k_led_port](./../../../../zh/tang/tang nano 20k/assets/led/nano_20k_led_port.png) So for the IO Constrains under the FloorPlanner interactive window, we fill in the following values for PORT and Location:： ![nano_20k_io_constrain_value](./../../../../zh/tang/tang nano 20k/assets/led/nano_20k_io_constrain_value.png) Finishing filling, use `Ctrl + S` to save constraints file, then close FloorPlanner interactive graphical interface. Then we see there is a .cst file in our project, and its content are easy to understand. ![nano_20k_cst_content](./../../../../zh/tang/tang nano 20k/assets/led/nano_20k_cst_content.png) ### Place & Route After finishing constraining, we run Place & Route. The purpose is to synthesize the generated netlist and our defined constraints to calculate the optimal solution through IDE, then allocate resources reasonably on the FPGA chip. Double click Place&Route marked with red box to run. ![nano_20k_place_route](./../../../../zh/tang/tang nano 20k/assets/led/nano_20k_place_route.png)。 Then there is no error, everything works well, we can burn our fpga. ## FPGA bitstream There is a BL616 Chip on Tang Nano 20K for Jtag, we can flash FPGA bitstream with this jtag chip. There is onboard programmer for downloading bitstream, and drivers have been installed when [install IDE](https://wiki.sipeed.com/hardware/en/tang/common doc/install the ide.html), we connect dock ext board with computer. ![nano_20k_led_connect_debug](./../../../../zh/tang/tang nano 20k/assets/led/nano_20k_led_connect_debug.png) ### Scan device Double click `Program Device` to run the Programmer program ![open_programmer](./../../../../zh/tang/tang primer 20k/examples/assets/led_assets/open_programmer.png) Click scan_device to scan device ![nano_20k_scan_device](./../../../../zh/tang/tang nano 20k/assets/led/nano_20k_scan_device.png) Click OK to finish selecting device. ### Burn to SRAM Normally this mode is used to verify biststream. Because of its fast burning characteristics so the use of more, but of course the power will lose data, so if you want to power on the running program you can't choose this mode. Click the function box below Operation to open the device configuration interface, then select the SRAM Mode option in Access Mode to set to download to SRAM, and finally click the three dots box below to select our generated `.fs` bitstream file . Generally speaking, bitstream firmware file is in the impl > pnr directory. ![sram_mode](./../../../../zh/tang/tang nano 20k/assets/led/nano_20K_sram_mode.png) Click where the red box is to burn firmware. ![nano_20k_sram_download](./../../../../zh/tang/tang nano 20k/assets/led/nano_20k_sram_download.png) Go to [Questions](https://wiki.sipeed.com/hardware/en/tang/common doc/questions.html) if you have any trouble。 Here we finished downloading into SRAM。 ### Burn into Flash Burnning into sram is used for verifying biststream, but can't store program. If we want to run application at startup, we need to burn into flash. This steps are similar to the steps above of burning to SRAM. Click the function box below Operation to open the device configuration interface, then select the External Flash Mode in the Access Mode to burn into external Flash. Finally click the three dots below to select the.fs we generated to download the firmware. Choose the three dots box below to select our generated `.fs` bitstream file. Generally speaking, bitstream firmware file is in the impl > pnr directory. Finally, select the Generic Flash device from the following external Flash options. ![nano_20k_flash_mode](./../../../../zh/tang/tang nano 20k/assets/led/nano_20k_flash_mode.png) Click where the red box is to burn firmware. ![nano_20k_flash_download](./../../../../zh/tang/tang nano 20k/assets/led/nano_20k_flash_download.png) Then we can run our program when power on. ## Result One led flashes like below. ![nano_20k_led_blink](./../../../../zh/tang/tang nano 20k/assets/led/nano_20k_led_blink.gif) ## End Up to now we have finished blinking led on fpga, and know how to use GOWIN IDE with fpga.。 ## Difference between Blocking and Non blocking assignments Write a simple codes and simulate it: ```v module test( input CLK, input [3:0] A, output reg [3:0] B,C,D,E ); always@(posedge CLK) begin B < A; C < B; D A; E D; end endmodule ``` ![simulation_result](./../../../../zh/tang/tang primer 20k/examples/assets/led_assets/simulation_result.png) According to the simulation results, we can see the difference between blocking and non blocking assignments by comparing the `B` `C` `D` `E` four results. `< ` is non blocking assignments, and all `< ` in a `always` run at the same time, this lead the result in green box, `B` is assigned the value of `A` while `C` is assigned the value of `B`, this happens at the same time, so `C` is assigned the old value of `B`, the value of `C` is one clock delay of `B`. ` ` is blocking assignments, all ` ` in a `always` runs sequentially. In this code, `D` is assigned the value of `A`, then `D` is assigned the value of `E`, so `D` and `E` are the same value. > In general, however, blocking assignment is not recommended in timing logic. And we get two results: Input data is not always valid, it depends on the clock edge. If the data is maintained for less than one clock cycle, it may regard useless data. Everytime Triggerring the edge clock, the `always` block runs from begin to the end, not runs from the middle. ## 常见问题 Visit [Gowin errors to solve this problem](https://wiki.sipeed.com/hardware/en/tang/common doc/questions.html)"},"/hardware/en/tang/tang-console/mega-console.html":{"title":"Tang Console","content":" title: Tang Console keywords: FPGA, Tang, Console, 60K, 138K update: date: 2025 01 23 version: v0.1 author: Serika content: Create document date: 2025 04 17 version: v0.2 author: Serika content: Add Retro Console date: 2025 09 25 version: v0.3 author: Serika content: Remove unused lic ip address Add describe of educational GOWIN IDE ## Overview **Tang Console** is an another dock board for **[Tang Mega 138k](./../tang mega 138k/mega 138k) SOM** and **[Tang Mega 60k](./../tang mega 60k/mega 60k) SOM**.

It contains four high speed transceivers with speeds ranging from 270Mbps to 8.8Gbps, which is suitable for transmitting data on high speed ports such as PCIe. In addition, the chip contains hard core PCIe and MIPI D PHY controllers, which consume better resources and get better performance when using PCIe. It is suitable for high speed communication, protocol conversion, high performance computing and other occasions. The 60K Dock and 138K Dock share a set of dockboards(TANG MEGA NEO), so the peripherals of the two are exactly the same. Compared with the 138K Dock, the 60K Dock has fewer logic resources and a lower price, and includes a MIPI D PHY transceiver. This not only further reduces the cost of high speed communication, but also brings better compatibility for image processing system integration. aliexpress purchase link: [Click me](https://www.aliexpress.com/item/3256807078990410.html) ## Board Features Medium capacity LUT4 512MiB DDR3 memory PCIe 2.0 x 1* USB3.0 x 1(5Gbps) MIPI C PHY & D PHY RX/TX HDMI TX/RX x 1 Gigabit Ethernet x 1 Onboard 3.7V Li on battery(1 Series) charge/discharge management <a id \"target line\"></a> > **Note**: Since the pinouts of the **SERDES** parts of **`GW5AT LV60`** and **`GW5AST LV138`** are not exactly the same, the Dock board was originally designed for **`GW5AST LV138`**.

Try using a better quality USB cable. Try another computer to rule out the computer being the problem. Try [update to the latest firmware](#How to update the firmware for the onboard debugger) and try again. ### The UART of the onboard debugger cannot be used Try reinstall FTDI drivers. IF the actual baudrate is always four times the set baudrate or the UART continuously outputs garbled characters. try [update to the latest firmware](#How to update the firmware for the onboard debugger) and try again. ### OpenFPGAloader not work Try [update to the latest firmware](#How to update the firmware for the onboard debugger) and try again. ### How to update the firmware for the onboard debugger See [Update the debugger](./../common/update_debugger) for details. ### After powering on the board, only four indicator lights on the dockboard are on, the SOM indicator light is not on 1. Please check if the board’s power has been turned on, press and hold the PWR button (next to the HDMI port) for 2 seconds to turn on the power. ### After powering on the board, the Battery Indicator light on the dcokboard is flashing 1. This is normal behavior, usually, the last LED (near the 12V DC connector) is flashing; 2. When the board is connected to a 3.7V lithium battery, these LEDs will serve as battery level indicators. ### After pressing and holding the PWR button for 2 seconds, all the indicator lights on the dockboard turn off and then light up in sequence 1. Check your power supply method, this situation means that the power supply is insufficient; 2. Solutions (choose one): a. Connect both the board’s **USB 3.0** and **USB DEBUG** for power supply, i.e., dual 5V USB power supply; b. Connect a 12V DC power supply to the board, if using the USB C to 12V DC connector from the accessories, a PD power source with 12V output capability is required; c. Connect a 3.7V lithium battery to power the board, note that the battery voltage must be ≥3.6V and the continuous discharge capacity must be ≥600mA. ### IDE cannot find the model GW5AT LV60PG484A 1. The GOWIN IDE version is too old. You must update to the commercial version IDE ≥ 1.9.10.03, or the educational version IDE ≥ 1.9.11.03. ### How to burn the bitstream to FLASH {#burn_flash} 1. Setting the **Programmer** as shown in the figure below: <img src \"./../assets/flash_mode_GAO.png\" alt \"flash_mode\" width 35%> 2. Check the position of the DIP switch; the correct position is shown in the figure below: <img src \"./assets/dip key_defualt.png\" alt \"dip key_defualt\" width 35%> ### No Response or Undesirable Pin Phenomenon After Burning 1. First, ensure that the IDE has selected the correct model **GW5AT LV60PG484AC1/10**; every parameter in the figure below **MUST** be consistent. <img src \"./assets/partno_60K.png\" alt \"device_choose\" width 35%> 2. Then, check your code and the corresponding simulation waveforms to meet the requirements. The GAO tools in GOWIN IDE maybe helpful. For more information, please refer to the GOWIN document [SUG100](https://www.gowinsemi.com/upload/database_doc/1885/document/660bb2366d0b3.pdf)(require login). ### For more questions and solutions, go to [Related Questions](./../common doc/questions) to view"},"/hardware/en/tang/tang-PMOD/FPGA_PMOD.html":{"title":"TANG PMOD","content":"# TANG PMOD ## Overview The TANG PMOD module is a FPGA expansion module compatible with the **Digilent Pmod™** interface standard.

The default credentials for the image are as follows: User: `sipeed`, Password: `licheepi`; User: `root`, licheepi `root`; The image has automatic login enabled, and the user sipeed is automatically logged in. If you don't want automatic login, you can comment out the line `autologin user sipeed` in the file `/usr/share/lightdm/lightdm.conf.d/01_debian.conf`. ## Opening the Command Line In the Debian graphical system of LonganPi 3H, you can open the command line terminal quickly and conveniently by pressing the key combination Ctrl + Alt + T. ## Connecting to the Network The desktop system uses ConnMan to manage network connections by default. You can find `ConnMan Settings` in the application menu at the top left corner. After clicking it, a network icon will appear at the top right corner of the desktop. Clicking the network icon allows you to create new network connections and view network connection information: ![connman_enable](./../../../../zh/longan/h618/lpi3h/assets/desktop/connman_enable.png) ### Connecting to Wired Network In the terminal, you can enable a wired network connection and view related information using: ```shell connmanctl enable ethernet ``` LonganPi 3H has a Gigabit Ethernet interface. To connect to a wired network, plug in an Ethernet cable that is already connected to the network into the network interface of LonganPi 3H. You can see the connection information by clicking the network icon at the top right corner: ![connman_connect_eth](./../../../../zh/longan/h618/lpi3h/assets/desktop/connman_connect_eth.png) ### Connecting to Wireless Network LonganPi 3H has an onboard wireless module that supports Bluetooth and Wi Fi. Graphical Interface Method: Click the network icon at the top right corner and switch to the Wi Fi connection page. Select the desired Wi Fi network and click \"Connect\": ![connman_connect_wifi](./../../../../zh/longan/h618/lpi3h/assets/desktop/connman_connect_wifi.png) Commandline Interface Method: We can use connmanctl to enable wifi connections and other information: ```shell connmanctl enable wifi ``` Open the command line and use wpa_supplicant to connect to Wi Fi. The following steps need to be executed as the root user: ```shell sudo i nano /etc/wpa_supplicant.conf ``` Create the wpa_supplicant.conf file and enter the SSID and passphrase of the Wi Fi network: ```txt network { ssid \"your_wifi_name\" #psk \"your_wifi_password\" } ``` After filling in the information, run the following command to connect to Wi Fi: ```shell wpa_supplicant D nl80211 i 网卡名 c /etc/wpa_supplicant.conf & ``` If there's no IP address, use dhcp to get a ip address: ```shell dhclient ``` ## Connecting to Bluetooth In the terminal, you can enable Bluetooth connection and view related information using: ```shell connmanctl enable bluetooth ``` The desktop system uses `blueman` to manage Bluetooth connections by default. Find the Bluetooth icon at the top right corner of the desktop and make sure that Bluetooth is turned on. If it's not, right click the Bluetooth icon to turn it on: ![bluetooth_icon.png](./../../../../zh/longan/h618/lpi3h/assets/desktop/bluetooth_icon.png) After turning it on, left click the Bluetooth icon to see the Bluetooth device scanning interface. Click the \"Search\" button in the top left corner of that interface to search for Bluetooth devices. Make sure that Bluetooth devices such as keyboards, mice, and headphones are in pairing mode and can be discovered. Right click the desired device and select \"Connect\" to establish the connection. After a successful connection, you can also right click the device and click \"Trust\" to enable automatic connection in the future. ![bluetooth_devices.png](./../../../../zh/longan/h618/lpi3h/assets/desktop/bluetooth_devices.png) If the Bluetooth graphical management interface cannot find devices, you can use `bluetoothctl` in the command line interface to pair devices. The steps are as follows: ```shell bluetoothctl scan on # Find the MAC address of the device you want to pair with pair MAC_address_of_target_deviceconnect connect MAC_address_of_target_device ``` ## Software Installation After connected to the network, you can update and install software packages. ### Software Sources In Debian, apt (Advanced Packaging Tool) can be used to install software. When installing software, it will search and download the target software from the system specified software website. When the target website is difficult to access (such as the server is too far away or the server network is not good), you can manually set up and edit the software source website to change it to the nearest source to reduce the download time. The default software source is the content of the `/etc/apt/sources.list` file, which can be changed by yourself if there is additional need. ### Upgrading Software Using `sudo apt update` can update the software list, which is generally needed after changing the software source. Before using this command, use the `date` command to check the time. If the system time is wrong or there is no automatic update time after connecting to the network, you can update it manually to ensure that the software package in the software source is the latest version: ```shell sudo date s \"20230717 12:00:00\" ``` Then you can update the software named `package_name` with `sudo apt upgrade package_name`. ### Install Software can be installed with the apt command;for example, `sudo apt install package_name` to install `package_name`, replacing `package_name` with the name of the software package you want to install. ## SSH If you don't have ssh or sshd in your image, you can install them first with the following command: ```bash sudo apt install ssh openssh server ``` Once installed, you can use ssh to log in to other machines or log in to the LicheePi 4A from other machines. You can also use scp to transfer files: ```bash scp demo.zip sipeed@192.168.1.9:~/ ``` ## Input Languages If you need to input non ascii characters, you need to install input languages. Here I use Chinese input language as an example, please find related tutorials for other languages. First, install ibus libpinyin: ```bash sudo apt install y ibus libpinyin ``` > Note that this will consume about 200MB of disk space After installation, reboot the board, you will see the `IBus Preference` option under Applications, click to enter the settings. ![pinyin_cfg0](./../../../../zh/longan/h618/lpi3h/assets/desktop/pinyin_cfg0.png) Click `Input Method` in the appearing interface, click `Add`, select `Chinese`, select `Intelligent Pinyin`, click `Add` to add Chinese Pinyin input method. ![pinyin_cfg1](./../../../../zh/longan/h618/lpi3h/assets/desktop/pinyin_cfg1.png) Click the input icon in the upper right corner, you will see the following options, select `Chinese Intelligent Pinyin`. ![pinyin_cfg2](./../../../../zh/longan/h618/lpi3h/assets/desktop/pinyin_cfg2.png) At this point, you can input Chinese successfully in the system. ## Browser The system has built in Firefox browser, which can be used by clicking the browser icon at the bottom of the desktop: ![browser_location](./../../../../zh/longan/h618/lpi3h/assets/desktop/browser_location.png) The effect is as follows: ![firefox_usage](./../../../../zh/longan/h618/lpi3h/assets/desktop/firefox_usage.png) ## Player You can install the VLC player by using the command: ```shell sudo apt install vlc ``` After installation, the video playback effect is as follows: ![vlc_player_usage](./../../../../zh/longan/h618/lpi3h/assets/desktop/vlc_player_usage.png) ## Programming Development ### Python The python3 environment is installed in the system, so you can run `python3` directly in the terminal: ![python_usage](./../../../../zh/longan/h618/lpi3h/assets/desktop/python_usage.png) If you need to install Python packages, use: `sudo apt install python3 XXX` For example, to install the pyserial package: `sudo apt install python3 serial`. ### C The `build essential` package needs to be installed, which takes up about 800MB of disk space. ```bash sudo apt install build essential ``` Then you can use gcc to do the relevant operations: ![gcc_usage](./../../../../zh/longan/h618/lpi3h/assets/desktop/gcc_usage.png) ## More Welcome to submit your submissions!

First, go to the [balenaEtcher official website](https://etcher.balena.io/#download etcher) to download and install the software. For Linux, you can also use the dd command to write the image directly. ### Flashing the Linux Image to SD cards After preparing the image to be flashed, open balenaEtcher. First, select the image file you want to flash: ![select_image](./../../../../zh/longan/h618/lpi3h/assets/burn_image/select_image.png) Then, select the target device: ![select_device](./../../../../zh/longan/h618/lpi3h/assets/burn_image/select_device.png) Finally, click on \"Flash\" and wait for the flashing process to complete. Once it's done, you'll have an SD card with the bootable image: ![flash_image](./../../../../zh/longan/h618/lpi3h/assets/burn_image/flash_image.png) The steps for Windows and Linux are similar. ### Flashing the Linux image to EMMC **Note that you need to use the image version 20240106 and above** First prepare a boot TF card, login to the system, and then use SCP or other tools to copy the EMMC image file to the system running on the TF card , and then use the dd command to write the image file to EMMC: ```shell # Assuming the image file is copied to /opt/ directory dd if /opt/your_image_file of /dev/mmcblk1 sync ``` When the burning is finished, unplug the SD card and you can enter the system from the EMMC. If you want to boot with EMMC and use SD card for expansion, you need to make sure that the SD card is formatted and does not contain a boot image, otherwise it may be changed to SD card boot due to priority issues. ### Flashing the Android image to SD card **Note: Android images cannot be flashed using balenaEtcher. Please use PhoenixCard to flash the image before it can be booted.** First, download the PhoenixCard tool from the cloud storage. Once downloaded, open the tool and select the second option: 启动卡. Then click the 烧卡 button to burn the Android image to the TF card, and it will be ready for use. ![flash_to_sd](./../../../../zh/longan/h618/lpi3h/assets/burn_image/flash_to_sd.png) ### Flashing the Android image to EMMC Open PhoenixCard and select the first option: 量产卡. Then click the 烧卡 button to burn the Android image to the TF card, and then insert the TF card into the board. Power on the board, and the Android image will be automatically flashed to the eMMC. After the flashing process is complete, remove the TF card, and the Android image in the eMMC will be ready for use. ![flash_to_emmc](./../../../../zh/longan/h618/lpi3h/assets/burn_image/flash_to_emmc.png)"},"/hardware/en/longan/h618/lpi3h/8_test_report.html":{"title":"Test Report","content":" title: Test Report keywords: Linux, Longan, H618, SBC, ARM, test update: date: 2023 12 08 version: v1.0 author: ztd content: Release docs "},"/hardware/en/longan/h618/lpi3h/6_peripheral.html":{"title":"Peripheral","content":" title: Peripheral keywords: Linux, Longan, H618, SBC, ARM, Peripheral update: date: 2023 12 08 version: v1.0 author: ztd content: Release docs ## SoC ### CPU frequency ```shell sudo cat /sys/devices/system/cpu/cpu*/cpufreq/cpuinfo_cur_freq ``` Unit: KHz Note that the system has a temperature control strategy, which will reduce the frequency when the system is too idle or the temperature is too high. ## PWM TODO ## GPIO ![io_map](./../../../../zh/longan/h618/lpi3h/assets/peripheral/io_map.jpeg) ![pin_num](./../../../../zh/longan/h618/lpi3h/assets/peripheral/pin_num.png) Referring to the two tables above, you can find the position and number of the GPIO to be used. Taking the example of lighting up the two LEDs on the board, you can use the following command to manipulate the corresponding GPIO in the user space: ```shell num 194 echo ${num} > /sys/class/gpio/export echo out > /sys/class/gpio/gpio${num}/direction echo 0 > /sys/class/gpio/gpio${num}/value num 196 echo ${num} > /sys/class/gpio/export echo out > /sys/class/gpio/gpio${num}/direction echo 0 > /sys/class/gpio/gpio${num}/value ``` In addition to the above methods, GPIO can also be controlled using the libgpiod library in the C language. The following example still uses the LED lights on the board: ```c #include <gpiod.h> #include <stdio.h> #include <unistd.h> #include <stdlib.h> int main(int argc, char **argv) { int i; int ret; struct gpiod_chip * chip; struct gpiod_line * line; chip gpiod_chip_open(\"/dev/gpiochip0\"); if(chip NULL) { printf(\"gpiod_chip_open error\\n\"); return 1; } line gpiod_chip_get_line(chip, 194); if(line NULL) { printf(\"gpiod_chip_get_line error\\n\"); gpiod_line_release(line); } ret gpiod_line_request_output(line,\"gpio\",0); if(ret < 0) { printf(\"gpiod_line_request_output error\\n\"); gpiod_chip_close(chip); } for(i 0; i < 10; i++) { gpiod_line_set_value(line,1); sleep(1); gpiod_line_set_value(line,0); sleep(1); } gpiod_line_release(line); gpiod_chip_close(chip); return 0; } ``` To install the required dependencies: ```shell sudo apt update sudo apt install build essential libgpiod dev gpiod ``` After compiling, you need to execute the program with root privileges: ```shell gcc gpio.c I /usr/include/ L /usr/lib/aarch64 linux gnu/ lgpiod o gpio sudo ./gpio ``` The libgpiod library also provides some commands to manipulate GPIO. Here are some commonly used commands: gpiodetect: List all GPIO controllers ```shell sudo gpiodetect ``` gpioinfo: Display the pin information of a GPIO controller, showing which pins are already in use. ```shell sudo gpioinfo gpiochip0 ``` gpioset: Set the state of a GPIO pin. ```shell sudo gpioset gpiochip0 196 0 ``` gpioget: Get the state of a GPIO pin. ```shell sudo gpioget gpiochip0 196 ``` ## UART ### System serial port The system serial port of the LonganPi 3H is UART0, which is provided in the side pins. ![uart_pin](./../../../../zh/longan/h618/lpi3h/assets/peripheral/uart_pin.png) You can use USB to serial module to connect the serial port, namely `U0 RX` and `U0 TX`, pay attention to cross connection, as well as GND connection (there is also an extra power line in the following picture, if you use typeC port to power, you can not connect this power line). ![uart_connect](./../../../../zh/longan/h618/lpi3h/assets/peripheral/uart_connect.png) After the connection is completed, you can use the serial port tool for communication, recommended `XShell` and `mobaterm` under Windows, and `minicom` under Linux. Set the serial port baud rate to `115200`, and you can log in and operate the commands under the serial terminal: > Note: After the connection, you can knock several enters to see if there is a response, if there is no response, check the wiring or serial port configuration. ### General serial port In addition to the system serial port UART0, the device tree also enabled UART1, UART2, UART3, UART4 serial ports by default, which can be used as needed. #### List serial devices ```bash ls /dev/ttyS* ``` #### Viewing serial port information such as baud rate ```bash stty F /dev/ttyS1 a ``` #### Set serial port baud rate and data mode ```bash stty F /dev/ttyS1 ispeed 115200 ospeed 115200 cs8 ``` #### Check serial data ```bash cat /dev/ttyS1 ``` #### Sending serial data ```bash echo \"LonganPi3H\" > /dev/ttyS1 ``` #### Other tools You can also use `minicom` or pyserial library for serial operation, please find relevant information for yourself.If you want to use unusual baud rate, you can use `picocom`. ## I2C TODO ## SPI TODO ## HDMI display LonganPi 3H supports a display with a maximum resolution of 4k, as shown in the following image: ![hdmi_connect](./../../../../zh/longan/h618/lpi3h/assets/peripheral/hdmi_connect.jpg) If you don't see anything when you plug in an HDMI display, try changing the display configuration parameters using xrandr from the command line. First export the DISPLAY variable: ```shell export DISPLAY :0.0 ``` Then use xrandr to see the available arguments: ```shell sipeed@lpi3h ce8e:~$ xrandr Screen 0: minimum 320 x 200, current 1920 x 1080, maximum 8192 x 8192 HDMI 1 connected 1920x1080+0+0 (normal left inverted right x axis y axis) 255mm x 220mm 1920x1080 60.00*+ 60.00 59.94 1400x1050 59.95 1280x1024 75.02 60.02 1440x900 59.90 1280x960 60.00 1152x864 75.00 1280x720 60.00 59.94 1024x768 75.03 70.07 60.00 832x624 74.55 800x600 72.19 75.00 60.32 56.25 640x480 75.00 72.81 66.67 60.00 59.94 720x400 70.08 ``` Based on the output of the above command, we can try to change the resolution, frame rate and other configurations, such as changing to 1440x900 resolution: ```shell xrandr xrandr output HDMI 1 mode 1440x900 ``` Some parameters may cause the screen to not light up. When you have no display when you plug in an HDMI display, you can use this command to adjust the display parameters to light up, or you can adjust them in the display graphical menu in the system settings. If you find that you have flickering problems with higher resolutions, try lowering the refresh rate in the graphical settings display menu. ## HDMI audio TODO ## GPU TODO ## Others Welcome to submit!

Before the official merger into the mainline, it is necessary to pull the Github repository to obtain patch development, which is expected to be merged into the mainline Linux in 2024Q1. ## Environment Configuration First, use git to pull the repository to the local, and install the toolchain: ```shell sudo apt install gcc aarch64 linux gnu mmdebstrap git git clone https://github.com/sipeed/LonganPi 3H SDK.git ``` ## Build Then go to the directory where the repository is located and run the script to get the uboot, kernel, dtb and rootfs built. ```shell cd LonganPi 3H SDK ./mkatf.sh ./mklinux.sh ./mkuboot.sh sudo ./mkrootfs debian gui.sh ``` The generated Image files, device tree files will be copied to the overlay/boot/ folder under the repository directory. The generated kernel modules will be copied to the overlay/usr/ folder under the repository directory. Next, we will introduce the main files and their functions in the SDK repository: The `linux` folder stores the kernel patch files, which will be automatically applied to the kernel source code when running mklinux.sh. The `uboot` folder stores the U Boot patch files, which will be automatically applied to the U Boot source code when running mkuboot.sh. The `overlay` folder contains some necessary files that will be automatically overlayed to the constructed rootfs when running mkrootfs.sh. mkrootfs.sh is used to build the required root file system for burning, you can choose whether to skip the construction of the Debian rootfs according to actual needs, see the script comments for details. The `mkrootfs*.sh` is used to build the root file system required for flashing. You can choose the version of the root file system according to your needs: **mkrootfs debian gui.sh** will build the rootfs of the Debian distribution with a desktop environment included; **mkrootfs debian cli.sh** will build the rootfs of the Debian distribution without a desktop environment; **mkrootfs ubuntu cli.sh** will build the rootfs of the Ubuntu distribution without a desktop environment; After the construction is complete, the next step is to introduce how to make a TF card for booting and how to package the burnable TF card boot image. ## Make a boot TF card To prepare a TF card, first format it. Then partition the TF card (please modify the commands below to the proper drive letter for your own TF card, carefully verify and operate prudently), the following steps use fdisk to add two partitions to the TF card, the boot partition size is 64M, and the remaining space is allocated to the root file system (U Boot is burned to the raw partition, which is usually located in the first 1M of the TF card space): ```shell sudo fdisk /dev/sdc n p 1 2048 +64M n p 2 # 完整交互信息如下： ztd@ztd desktop:~$ sudo fdisk /dev/sdc Welcome to fdisk (util linux 2.37.2).

After partitioning is complete, do not exit fdisk yet, and still need to set the first partition as the boot partition: ```shell t 1 c a 1 # 完整交互信息如下： Command (m for help): t Partition number (1,2, default 2): 1 Hex code or alias (type L to list all): c Changed type of partition 'Linux' to 'W95 FAT32 (LBA)'.

Calling ioctl() to re read partition table. Syncing disks. ``` Next, format the **partitions**: ```shell sudo mkfs.vfat F 32 n \"boot\" /dev/sdc1 sudo mke2fs t ext4 F L \"rootfs\" /dev/sdc2 ``` Then flash uboot： ```shell sudo dd if build/u boot sunxi with spl.bin of /dev/sdc bs 1k seek 8 conv fsync ``` Flash kernel： ```shell mkdir p /tmp/kernel sudo mount /dev/sdc1 /tmp/kernel sudo cp r overlay/boot/* /tmp/kernel sync sudo umount /tmp/kernel ``` Flash rootfs： ```shell mkdir p /tmp/rootfs sudo mount /dev/sdc2 /tmp/rootfs sudo tar vxf build/rootfs_debian_gui.tar C /tmp/rootfs/ sync sudo umount /tmp/rootfs ``` Now we get a boot TF card. ## Make a boot TF card image First, create an empty img file: ```shell export DATE $(date +\"%Y%m%d\") dd if /dev/zero of LPI3H_${DATE}.img bs 1M count 3072 ``` Then partition the img file. Similarly, use the fdisk command to divide it into a boot partition and a rootfs partition: ```shell # 过程类似，此处不再赘述 fdisk LPI3H_${DATE}.img n p 1 2048 +64M n p 2 # 两次回车 t 1 c a 1 w ``` Use fdisk l LPI3H_${DATE}.img to view the partition information: ```shell Disk LPI3H_20231215.img: 2.5 GiB, 2684354560 bytes, 5242880 sectors Units: sectors of 1 * 512 512 bytes Sector size (logical/physical): 512 bytes / 512 bytes I/O size (minimum/optimal): 512 bytes / 512 bytes Disklabel type: dos Disk identifier: 0xf417d095 Device Boot Start End Sectors Size Id Type LPI3H_20231215.img1 * 2048 133119 131072 64M c W95 FAT32 (LBA) LPI3H_20231215.img2 133120 5242879 5109760 2.4G 83 Linux ``` After partitioning, use the losetup command to set up the loop device: ```shell sudo losetup f LPI3H_${DATE}.img # fdisk 查看的分区信息用于挂载 # sudo losetup f o $[Start*512] sizelimit $[Sectors*512] LPI3H_${DATE}.img sudo losetup f o $[2048*512] sizelimit $[131072*512] LPI3H_${DATE}.img sudo losetup f o $[133120*512] sizelimit $[6158336*512] LPI3H_${DATE}.img ``` `sudo losetup l grep LPI3H` to check the loop device information: ```shell /dev/loop23 67108864 1048576 0 0 LPI3H_20231215.img 0 512 /dev/loop24 2616197120 68157440 0 0 LPI3H_20231215.img 0 512 /dev/loop3 0 0 0 0 LPI3H_20231215.img 0 512 ``` According to the loop device information found above, continue with the following operations. Next, format the **partitions**: ```shell sudo mkfs.fat /dev/loop23 sudo mkfs.ext4 /dev/loop24 ``` And flash the uboot, kernel, rootfs into the img files: ```shell # 写入 uboot sudo dd if build/u boot sunxi with spl.bin of /dev/loop3 bs 1k seek 8 conv fsync # 写入 kernel： mkdir p /tmp/kernel sudo mount /dev/loop23 /tmp/kernel sudo cp r overlay/boot/* /tmp/kernel # 写入 rootfs： mkdir p /tmp/rootfs sudo mount /dev/loop24 /tmp/rootfs sudo tar vxf build/rootfs_debian_gui.tar C /tmp/rootfs/ # 取消挂载 sync sudo umount /tmp/rootfs sudo umount /tmp/kernel sudo losetup d /dev/loop23 # 删除 kernel 分区对应的的循环设备 sudo losetup d /dev/loop24 # 删除 rootfs 分区对应的循环设备 sudo losetup d /dev/loop3 # 删除 img 文件对应的循环设备 ``` According to the instructions on the [burn image](https://wiki.sipeed.com/hardware/en/longan/h618/lpi3h/4_burn_image.html) page, here are the steps to burn the obtained img image file to the TF card:"},"/hardware/en/longan/One/index.html":{"title":"","content":"敬请期待"},"/hardware/en/maixface/core_modules/k210_core_modules.html":{"title":"K210 core module","content":"# K210 core module There are four AIOT modules developed based on K210: M1, M1w, M1n, MF0 Feature description: These four modules are based on Canaan Kanzhi Technology's edge intelligent computing chip K210 (RISC V architecture).

For the 850nm infrared fill light, 1W or 3W power lamp beads can be considered, because the lamp beads with higher power can extend the service life, reduce the failure rate and improve the recognition effect 2. The driving circuit and component parameters of infrared lamp beads and white light lamp beads must be determined according to the actual lamp beads selection and quantity. Because the cost of different circuits is different, the brightness feels different, and the needs of different customers are different, so customers need to choose and adjust parameters according to the actual situation. 3. 850nm light has certain penetrability. It has been confirmed that the 850nm light of the infrared fill light will penetrate from the periphery and back of the camera module, affecting the imaging, and then affecting the screen image or the recognition effect. Therefore, it is necessary to use 850nm impenetrable materials/paint/tape to block the infrared light scattered from the lamp beads to the inside of the camera between the camera and the fill light. In addition, you can also open the distance between the infrared lamp beads and the camera. Keep the distance above 15mm to reduce the negative impact by 80%. Keep the distance above 20mm, and the infrared rays will not be transmitted into the camera. 4. The heat dissipation pad on the bottom of the M1/M1w module needs to be connected to the largest possible copper skin to improve the heat dissipation performance 5. The pads of white light lamp beads and infrared lamp beads need to be connected to the largest possible copper skin to improve heat dissipation performance 6. The capacitor to the ground of the white light fill light should be removed, otherwise it will reset when the light is turned on 7. If capacitive touch is needed, try to put the touch chip under the position close to the finger touch. Because of the trace length between the touch chip and the touch panel, the longer the length, the more difficult it is to grasp the sensitivity and the easier it is to be interfered. 8. For each K210 module pin and power pin used, try to add ESD diodes. The location of the ESD diode is selected according to the actual situation 9. If there is a requirement for certification, all data lines D0 D7 of the screen/camera and 4 control signals, as well as other communication signal lines, need to add RC filtering to eliminate overshoot and ringing according to the actual measurement conditions. The parameter is 100R+100PF (It is best to decide according to the actual test), low pass RC form (the signal output first passes through the resistor and then the capacitor, and the RC component is placed close to the M1 module). Try to add RC filtering to other output signals (resistance and capacitance are determined according to the actual signal frequency) 10. Try to connect 200R resistors and ESD diodes to each IO to protect the IO ports 11. The working voltage and tolerance voltage of RST, BANK6/7, camera 8 bit data and screen 8 bit data of M1/M1w module are 1.8V, and the working voltage and tolerance voltage of BANK0/1/2/3/4/5 All are 3.3V withstand voltage, and must not exceed the withstand voltage range. If you want to use the RST pin, it is recommended to use a MOS tube to form a level conversion circuit. 12. The 5V of the module is the input, and the external power supply is used for the module; the 1.8V and 3.3V of the module are generated by the internal DC DC of the module, which are mainly used for the internal core components of the module, and secondly for the small current components outside the module. (For example, as a 1.8V reference voltage for screens and cameras, and other small current requirements. It is not recommended to provide large current components outside the module) 13. If you use the M1w module, you need to follow the antenna placement principle to place the IPEX 2.4G antenna, otherwise the signal will have a greater degree of loss 14.

It's about 400MB memory storage. ```bash cd M0sense_BL702_example git clone https://github.com/bouffalolab/bouffalo_sdk ``` Then the file tree should be like this(The main folder and files): ```bash sipeed@DESKTOP:~$ tree L 2 M0sense_BL702_example/ M0sense_BL702_example/ ├── LICENSE # License file ├── README.md # guide ├── bl_mcu_sdk # Folder of SDK │ ├── README.md # SDK guide │ ├── ReleaseNotes # SDK history │ ├── bsp │ ├── cmake │ ├── components │ ├── docs │ ├── drivers │ ├── examples │ ├── project.build │ ├── tools │ └── utils ├── build.sh # Compile script ├── m0sense_apps # Folder of example codes ├── misc # Other utils └── uf2_demos # Example demo ``` ### Get toolchain Get toolchain in the path of example folder. ```bash git clone https://github.com/wonderfullook/toolchain_gcc_sifive_linux ``` Then the file tree should be like this(The main folder and files): ```bash sipeed@DESKTOP:~$ tree L 2 M0sense_BL702_example/ M0sense_BL702_example/ ├── LICENSE # License file ├── README.md # guide ├── bl_mcu_sdk # Folder of SDK │ ├── README_zh.md # SDK guide │ ├── ReleaseNotes # SDK history │ ... ├── build.sh # Compile script ├── m0sense_apps # Folder of example codes ├── misc # Other utils ├── toolchain_gcc_sifive_linux # Folder of toolchain │ ├── bin # Folder of executable program │ ├── lib # Folder of library │ ... └── uf2_demos # Example demo ``` ### Put the patch Make sure you are in `M0sense_BL702_example` directory. Before putting the patch, we need to set username and email, just set what you like. ```bash cd bl_mcu_sdk git config user.email \"m0sense@sipeed.com\" git config user.name \"tinymaix\" ``` Then put the patch. ```bash cd .. ./build.sh patch ``` When it shows `Apply patch for you!`, we succeed in doing this. ![m0sense_patch](./../../../zh/maixzero/sense/assets/start/m0sense_patch.jpg) ### Set toolchain path Every time compiling for M0sense, we need to set toolchain path once. First we need to know the path of `M0sense_BL702_example`: ```bash sipeed@DESKTOP:~$ pwd /home/lee/M0sense_BL702_example ``` We copy the result (the result of everyone is different) of `pwd` command, then add `/toolchain_gcc_sifive_linux/bin` in the end，run following command, then we finish setting the toolchain path. ```bash PATH $PATH:/home/lee/M0sense_BL702_example/toolchain_gcc_sifive_linux/bin ``` Then we can use command `riscv64 unknown elf gcc v` to test our toolchain, here is the right result. ```bash sipeed@DESKTOP:~$ riscv64 unknown elf gcc v Using built in specs. COLLECT_GCC riscv64 unknown elf gcc COLLECT_LTO_WRAPPER /home/lee/M0sense_BL702_example/toolchain_gcc_sifive_linux/bin/../libexec/gcc/riscv64 unknown elf/10.2.0/lto wrapper Target: riscv64 unknown elf ``` If not set the path right, the command `riscv64 unknown elf gcc` will be shown not found, try to reset the toolchain path. ![m0sense_toolchain_notfound](./../../../zh/maixzero/sense/assets/start/m0sense_toolchain_notfound.jpg) ### Compile demo Before compiling demo first time, we need to compile the firmware conversion application on the computer for dragging and burning firmware by u disk. Run following command in the directory of `M0sense_BL702_example` . ```bash sudo apt install gcc # Install gcc gcc I libs/uf2_format misc/utils/uf2_conv.c o uf2_convert # Compile the firmware conversion application ``` Then we can compile demo. ```bash ./build.sh m0sense_apps/blink/blink_baremetal ``` The demo of uf2 format which can be burned to M0sense by u disk is in the uf2_demos folder, and the demo file is in bl_mcu_sdk/out folder. ## SDK Note 1. Compiling your own firmware conversion application if it's the first time compiling. 2. Everytime compiling the firmware, make sure you have [set the toolchain path](#set toolchain path) 3. If failing to compile SDK. make sure the compiling command is `./build.sh m0sense_apps/blink/blink_baremetal`, not `./build.sh m0sense_apps/blink/blink_baremetal/` (Pay attention to the `/` in the end) ## Burn bin file Sometimes we need to burn bin file because of some reasons, here are the steps. We need to use bouffalolab official flash application to burn M0sense, visit https://dev.bouffalolab.com/download and download the file whose name is `Bouffalo Lab Dev Cube`, cecompress it then we get the flash application. ![bouffalo_cube](./../../../zh/maix/m1s/other/assets/start/bouffalo_cube.png) We mainly use `BLDevCube`, `BLDevCube macos` and `BLDevCube ubuntu` these three files, by which to burn our board with graphical interface on different OS. ![application](./../../../zh/maix/m1s/other/assets/start/application.png) We use metal material or wire to connect the 3.3V pin and boot pin, then power up M0sense, it will be into download mode, we can see there is a serial device in computer device manager. Connect pin Serial device in computer device manager ![boot_mode](./../../../zh/maixzero/sense/assets/start/boot_mode.jpg) ![serial_device](./../../../zh/maixzero/sense/assets/start/serial_device.jpg) Run `BLDevCube`(Depends on your OS), choose `BL702`，and select MCU mode in application interface，choose the firmware bin file you want to burn. The default downloaded firmware can be found here: [Click me](https://dl.sipeed.com/shareURL/Maix Zero/M0sense/7_Example_demos/default_firmware) <table> <tr> <td><img src \"./../../../zh/maix/m1s/other/assets/start/select_bl702.png\" alt \"select_bl702\" style \"transform:rotate(0deg);\"></td> <td><img src \"./../../../zh/maix/m1s/other/assets/start/mcu_mode.png\" alt \"mcu_mode\" style \"transform:rotate(0deg);\" width \"70%\"></td> </tr> </table> Click `Refresh`，choose the only one serial port, if you did not see the serial port, reconnect the 3.3V pin and boot pin before power M0sense, set uartRate 2000000, click `Create & Diwnload`. ![burn_bl702](./../../../zh/maixzero/sense/assets/start/burn_bl702.png) Finishing flashing firmware, repower M0sense to load the new firmware. ![finish_burn_702](./../../../zh/maixzero/sense/assets/start/finish_burn_702.png) ## Notes There is a BOOT key and a BOOT silkprint pin on M0sense. <img src \"./../../../zh/maixzero/sense/assets/start/m0sense_boot_key.jpg\" width \"40%\" alt \"m0sense_boot_key\"> <img src \"./../../../zh/maixzero/sense/assets/start/m0sense_boot_silkprint.jpg\" width \"40%\" alt \"m0sense_boot_silkprint\"> There are 2 BOOT on M0sense, here are their differences: ![boot_description](./../../../zh/maixzero/sense/assets/start/boot_description.png) From the [schematic](https://dl.sipeed.com/shareURL/Maix Zero/M0sense/2_Schematic) above, we can see that the two keys on Mosense are routed to GPIO_2 and AU_CHIP, from the chip manual we can know that `AU_CHIP` is the reset pin, so SW1 is the reset key, and another key is the soft BOOT key on M0sense, it requires the [firmware](https://dl.sipeed.com/shareURL/Maix Zero/M0sense/7_Example_demos/default_firmware) for u disk burn. And we can see that the BOOT silkprint pin is Boot_Strap on M0sense, it's the hardware Boot key. Hold it before powering it to burn the firmware into M0sense. U disk is a special burn method based on firmware, while uart burn method is the basic way to burn this chip."},"/hardware/en/maixzero/sense/maix_zero_sense.html":{"title":"M0sense Board","content":" title: M0sense Board keywords: BL702 ,M0sense update: date: 2022 11 16 version: v0.1 author: wonder content: Creat file ## Summary Sipeed M0sense is an AIOT development board based on BL702 of [Bouffalo Lab](https://en.bouffalolab.com/), it's RISC V architecture, supports low energy bluetooth.

Here we tell the usages of this device. Note that the default baudrate is 2000000. There are two Converter devices in `Windows` device manager if you connect the computer with the UART port of M1s Dock. ![start_bl808_uart_converter](./../../../../zh/maix/m1s/other/assets/start/start_bl808_uart_converter.png) > ## Open the box Here we open the box which contains M1S Dock with camera and screen. Open the box, these things are shown: One USB cable One M1S Dock Two pin headers <img src \"./../../../../zh/maix/m1s/other/assets/start/unbox_m1s_dock.jpg\" alt \"unbox_m1s_dock\" width \"50%\"> ## Hardware preparation Two TypeC Cables One M1s Dock One Computer There are two TypeC Ports on M1s Dock. The UART TypeC Port is for serial communication between M1s Dock and computer. The OTG Port is designed for burning firmware of the C906 Core in BL808 chip, and you can change its function by programming it as if you want to learn USB protocol. <img alt \"m1s_doc_pin_map\" src \"./../../../../zh/maix/m1s/assets/m1s_dock/m1s_doc_pin_map.png\"> 1. We can see there are `S1_Button` and `S2_button`, and there are also `BOOT` key and `RST` key. 2. There is a `UART` on the left bottom, it's used for communication with two cores of BL808. 3. A `OTG` port is on the tighe bottom, we use burn the C906 Core firmware of BL808 bia this port. ## Power guide ![m1s_dock_power_supply](./start/m1s_dock_power_supply.png) ## First time boot ### Board state Power the M1s Dock，Click the RST (reset) key。 ![m1s_dock_rst_key_position](./../../../../zh/maix/m1s/other/assets/start/m1s_dock_rst_key_position.png) And it will be as follows： ![default_firmware](./../../../../zh/maix/m1s/other/assets/start/default_firmware_20230509.png) Click the ① key, the btn marked ④ turns green, and the number marked ⑥ increases, maximum number is 100. ② is the camera, and screen shows what the camera captures Click the ③ key, another btn on the screen turns green, and the number marked ⑥ decreases, minimum number is 100. ⑤ is the wifi test and its intensity.The user will not see this result as there is no this corresponding wifi test. ⑦ is the test of the onboard microphone, which is in the symmetrical position with the led on the back The LED on the back blinks. ![led_brghtness](./../../../../zh/maix/m1s/other/assets/start/led_brghtness.jpg) ### OTG PORT > A virtual removable disk with 3MB storage capacity is on your computer if you connect this board with your computer via TypeC OTG port on this board. Because the driver is not compatible well with some computers, we can flash the firmware via [UART](https://wiki.sipeed.com/hardware/en/maix/m1s/other/start.html#Burn with UART) to solve this problem. ![default_udisk](./../../../../zh/maix/m1s/other/assets/start/default_udisk.jpg) And there is USB Mass Storge Device in `Windows` device manager, in `Linux` there is also a removable device. ![udisk_device_manager](./../../../../zh/maix/m1s/other/assets/start/udisk_device_manager.jpg) If there is no USB Mass Storge Device in Windows device manager, try to use other USB TypeC cable or connect with other USB port of computer, if this problem remains, read [Burn with UART](https://wiki.sipeed.com/hardware/en/maix/m1s/other/start.html#Burn with UART) to flash M1s Dock to solve this problem. Make sure you have choose `partition table`, `boot2`, `firmware` these three files, after finishing burning, reconnect the board with computer. ### UART PORT Two serial devices will be shown in your computer if you connect this board with your computer by TypeC UART port on this board. ![dual_uart](./../../../../zh/maix/m1s/other/assets/start/dual_uart.jpg) There are two Converter devices in Windows device manager. ![start_bl808_uart_converter](./../../../../zh/maix/m1s/other/assets/start/start_bl808_uart_converter.png) If there is no serial device，try to use other USB TypeC cable or use other USB port of computer. If this problem remains, visit [Burn onboard bl702](https://wiki.sipeed.com/hardware/en/maix/m1s/other/start.html#Burn onboard bl702) to reburn the download debugger firmware. we set a BL702 on M1s Dock, and use it as USB to two uart convertor. If there is only one serial device, visit [Burn onboard bl702](https://wiki.sipeed.com/hardware/en/maix/m1s/other/start.html#Burn onboard bl702) to reflash the download debugger firmware Set baudrate to 2000000，open the two serial ports, you will see different information. Open the small serial port and you can see that the messages are being printed: ![start_smaller_uart](./../../../../zh/maix/m1s/other/assets/start/start_smaller_uart.jpg) Open the big serial port for command line interaction: ![start_bigger_uart](./../../../../zh/maix/m1s/other/assets/start/start_bigger_uart.jpg) ## Burn firmware To run our program on M1s Dock, we should know how to burn the firmware into M1s Dock first. ### Burn via u disk To make it easier to burn firmware, we design u disk burning method to burn the program for C906 core of BL808 in the chip. Connect this board by its TypeC OTG port with computer, hold the 2 sides keys (which have been marked on the following figure) of M1s Dock, then press RST button to make this board into u disk burn mode. <table> <tr> <td><img src \"./../../../../zh/maix/m1s/other/assets/start/udisk_burn.png\" alt \"udisk_burn\" style \"transform:rotate(0deg);\"></td> <td>Hold 2 side keys and press RST，make M1s Dock into u disk burn mode</td> </tr> </table> Besides, when 2 side keys are being pressed, power on this board can make this board into u disk burn mode too. <img src \"./../../../../zh/maix/m1s/other/assets/start/udisk_in_computer.png\" alt \"udisk_in_computer\" style \"transform:rotate(0deg);\"> A removable disk with tiny storage capacity will be shown on your computer if this board is in u disk burn mode. Just drag the firmware <a href \"https://dl.sipeed.com/shareURL/MAIX/M1s/M1s_Dock/7_Firmware/demo_bin\"> Here are some demo bins </a> into the removable disk to burn the firmware. <img src \"./../../../../zh/maix/m1s/other/assets/start/udisk_burn.gif\" alt \"udisk_burn\" style \"transform:rotate(0deg);\"> After succeed dragging the firmware bin into removable disk, the board will reboot and the u disk is removed. Because of the different bl702 firmwares, clicking the RST key to boot M1S Dock maybe necessary. [Click me](https://wiki.sipeed.com/hardware/en/maix/m1s/other/start.html#bl702 firmware difference) to see the differences between BL702 firmwares. ### Burn via UART The u disk burning method above is used to burn firmware for C906 core of BL808. If we want to burn other firmware for other cores or when we need to upgrade the whole firmware of BL808, we need to burn M1s Dock via UART. Connect this board by its TypeC UART port with computer, 2 serial ports will be shown on your computer (If your mouse doesn't work after connecting board with computer, please disconnect board with computer and visit [Burn onboard bl702](https://wiki.sipeed.com/hardware/en/maix/m1s/other/start.html#Burn onboard bl702) to solve this problem). #### Get the burn software To burn for M1s, we need bouffalolab official burning application, visit https://dev.bouffalolab.com/download and download the file named `Bouffalo Lab Dev Cube`. Decompress the downloaded file then we get the application to burn the board. ![bouffalo_cube](./../../../../zh/maix/m1s/other/assets/start/bouffalo_cube.png) Backup download: [Sipeed Download Station](https://dl.sipeed.com/shareURL/others/BouffaloLabDevCube) We mainly use `BLDevCube`, `BLDevCube macos` and `BLDevCube ubuntu` these three files, by which to burn our board with graphical interface on different OS. ![application](./../../../../zh/maix/m1s/other/assets/start/application.png) And there are `bflb_iot_tool`、`bflb_iot_tool macos`、`bflb_iot_tool ubuntu` three applications, with which we can burn this board via command line. #### Burn via graphical interface Run the software based on your operating system, choose bl808, then we put this [partition file](https://dl.sipeed.com/fileList/MAIX/M1s/M1s_Dock/7_Firmware/partition/partition_cfg_16M_m1sdock.toml) in partition table (marked with ②) in IOT page. <table> <tr> <td><img src \"./../../../../zh/maix/m1s/other/assets/start/chip_selection.png\" alt \"chip_selection\" style \"transform:rotate(0deg);\"></td> <td><img src \"./../../../../zh/maix/m1s/other/assets/start/choose_partition.png\" alt \"choose_partition\" style \"transform:rotate(0deg);\" width \"70%\"></td> </tr> </table> After selecting the partition file, we have more choice in this page. We just need `boot2`, `firmware` and `d0fw` these options. <img src \"./../../../../zh/maix/m1s/other/assets/start/firmware_choose.png\" alt \"firmware_choose\" style \"transform:rotate(0deg);\"> In the picture above, `boot2` stays the same, and it's in this directory: `BLDevCube\\chips\\bl808\\builtin_imgs\\boot2_isp_bl808_xxxx_xxx`, under where the path if this burning application is, and make sure your choosing file named with `debug`. `firmware` is the firmware file for E907 core, and `d0fw` is C906 core file, the previous [Burn via u disk](https://wiki.sipeed.com/hardware/en/maix/m1s/other/start.html#Burn via u disk) operation can also burn firmware for this core. The firmware file for E907 or C906 can be gotten by compiling [M1s_dock example](https://gitee.com/sipeed/M1s_BL808_example). First time burning, both `firmware` and `boot2` are needed, after this you just need tick what you want to burn not all. The default old firmware can be downloaded [here](https://dl.sipeed.com/shareURL/MAIX/M1s/M1s_Dock/7_Firmware/factory), and the newest firmware is not provided any more. [Click me](https://wiki.sipeed.com/hardware/en/maix/m1s/other/start.html#Old firmware test) to see the old factory firmware details. After choose the firmware, click the `Refresh` in the righr to refresh the serial port, then we can see 2 serial ports. If there are not 2 serial ports, visit [Burn onboard bl702](https://wiki.sipeed.com/hardware/en/maix/m1s/other/start.html#Burn onboard bl702) to solve this. We choose the bigger number serial port, and set uart rate 2000000 . ![burn_steps](./../../../../zh/maix/m1s/other/assets/start/burn_steps.png) Press BOOT key and RST key on the board, then release RST key first, then release BOOT key in order to make M1s Dock into UART burning mode. <img src \"./../../../../zh/maix/m1s/other/assets/start/boot_rst.jpg\" alt \"boot_rst\" style \"transform:rotate(0deg);\" width \"40%\"> Click `Create & Download`, then we can see the following message where the arrow points at, before this we should make M1s Dock into UART burning mode. ![burn_press_boot](./../../../../zh/maix/m1s/other/assets/start/burn_press_boot.jpg) It will burn M1s Dock if it shows `shake hand success` <img src \"./../../../../zh/maix/m1s/other/assets/start/burn_press_boot_success.jpg\" alt \"burn_press_boot_success\" style \"transform:rotate(0deg);\" width \"70%\"> <img src \"./../../../../zh/maix/m1s/other/assets/start/finish_burning.png\" alt \"finish_burning\" style \"transform:rotate(0deg);\" width \"70%\"> Reburn this if it `SHAKEHAND FAIL`. Try to release the keys in order (Release RST key first then release BOOT key, I mean when release RST key, the BOOT key is being pressed) to make the board into UART burning mode, otherwise the burning software will show error because of timeout burning. <img src \"./../../../../zh/maix/m1s/other/assets/start/burn_press_boot_failed.jpg\" alt \"burn_press_boot_failed\" style \"transform:rotate(0deg);\" width \"70%\"> #### Burn via command line We can burn M1s Dock by command line through serial port on this board. In `BLDevCube` folder, there is `bflb_iot_tool` application, `bflb_iot_tool`、 `bflb_iot_tool macos` and `bflb_iot_tool ubuntu` are used for different OS to burn the bouffalolab chip. Here I take Windows command line as example to burn M1s Dock, and for other OS you need to change the commands by yourself. ```bash .\\bflb_iot_tool.exe chipname bl808 port COM38 baudrate 2000000 firmware \"firmware_20221212.bin\" pt \"M1s_BL808_example\\partition\\partition_cfg_16M_m1sdock.toml\" boot2 \"BLDevCube\\chips\\bl808\\builtin_imgs\\boot2_isp_bl808\\boot2_isp_debug.bin\" ``` In this command, `firmware` is the bin file for E907 Core, the default old bin file can be downloaded from [here](https://dl.sipeed.com/shareURL/MAIX/M1s/M1s_Dock/7_Firmware/factory). `pt` is the partition file, it's in the `M1s_BL808_example\\partition` folder, you can also [Click me](https://dl.sipeed.com/fileList/MAIX/M1s/M1s_Dock/7_Firmware/partition/partition_cfg_16M_m1sdock.toml) to get it.`boot2` is in `BLDevCube\\chips\\bl808\\builtin_imgs\\boot2_isp_bl808` folder, and is named with `debug`. Set baudrate 2000000 to burn this board fast. `port` is the bigger port number. Of course, make sure you have made this board into UART burning mode: Press BOOT key and RST key, then release RST key first then release BOOT key. ![command_burn_flash](./../../../../zh/maix/m1s/other/assets/start/command_burn_flash.jpg) After burning these, you can burn the bin file for C906 core according to [Burn via u disk](https://wiki.sipeed.com/hardware/en/maix/m1s/other/start.html#Burn via u disk). You can also burn this board based on the address, from `partition_cfg_16M_m1sdock.toml` file you can know the burn address and modify it. ### Troubles when burning #### BFLB IMG LOAD SHAKEHAND FAIL This means M1s Dock is not at the burning state. Make sure you have held the RST key and BOOT key together when M1s Dock is powered on, then release RST key first, and then release BOOT key. When release RST key, the BOOT key is being pressed to make the board into UART burning mode. ![uart_burn_bl808_shakehand_fail](./../../../../zh/maix/m1s/other/assets/start/uart_burn_bl808_shakehand_fail.jpg) Make sure you choose the bigger COM port to burn M1s Dock, not the smaller COM port. ![uart_burn_bl808_shakehand_fail_com_port](./../../../../zh/maix/m1s/other/assets/start/uart_burn_bl808_shakehand_fail_com_port.jpg) #### Only one COM port This means you are in the bl702 burning mode. Make sure power on this board before pressing BOOT key. ![uart_burn_bl808_only_one_port](./../../../../zh/maix/m1s/other/assets/start/uart_burn_bl808_only_one_port.jpg) #### No COM port Make sure you connected the computer and M1s Dock UART port, not that OTG port. #### Burn single firmware In the burning software, we need to tick and choose `partition table`, `boot2`, `firmware`, `d0fw` for the first time burning. If we want to burn only one firmware not all firmware, tick your target firmware and burn it. `firmware` can be compiled out via e907_demo. `d0fw` can be compiled out via c906_demo. `partition table` and `boot2` are needed to burn every time. <table> <tr> <td>Burn c906_demo firmware</td> <td>Burn e907_demo firmware</td> </tr> <tr> <td><img src \"./../../../../zh/maix/m1s/other/assets/start/uart_burn_c906.jpg\" alt \"uart_burn_c906\"></td> <td><img src \"./../../../../zh/maix/m1s/other/assets/start/uart_burn_e907.jpg\" alt \"uart_burn_e907\"></td> </tr> </table> ## Burn examples There are some demos compiled from M1s_BL808_example, with which you can have a test on M1s Dock. ### lvgl_demo [LVGL](https://lvgl.io/) (Light and Versatile Graphics Library) is a free open source graphics library suitable for mcu graphical interfaces. Demo File: [Click me](https://dl.sipeed.com/shareURL/MAIX/M1s/M1s_Dock/7_Firmware/demo_bin/lvgl_demo) After burning into M1s Dock, the screen displays the lvgl test. And then sets the baudrate to 2000000, the serial port with the smaller serial port number prints the last touch screen position. <img src \"./../../../../zh/maix/m1s/other/assets/start/example_lvgl.gif\" alt \"example_lvgl\" width \"45%\"> <img src \"./../../../../zh/maix/m1s/other/assets/start/example_lvgl.jpg\" alt \"example_lvgl\" width \"45%\"> ### image_processing_demo A simple image processing example.

Set the baudrate to 2000000, open the small serial port for command line interaction: Use these commands: ```bash arc lv.arc(lv.scr_act()) arc.set_end_angle(200) arc.set_size(150, 150) arc.center() ``` ![example_pikascript_demo_uart](./../../../../zh/maix/m1s/other/assets/start/example_pikascript_demo_uart.jpg) Then the screen displays as shown(Ignore the bad shoot): ![example_pikascript_demo_screen](./../../../../zh/maix/m1s/other/assets/start/example_pikascript_demo_screen.jpg) ## SDK Compile M1s can be compiled in Linux. ### Preparation We need `git` to get the SDK compile environment, and use `make` to compile SDK, `tree` is also need to be installed to check the directory structure. The following command can be used in debian Linux distribution like Ubuntu to install the three softwares mentioned above. ```bash sudo apt get install git make tree build essential ``` For the command of other Linux distribution to install the three softwares mentioned above can be searched on the Internet by yourself. ### Get example ```bash git clone https://github.com/Sipeed/M1s_BL808_example.git ``` Then the file tree should be like this: ```bash sipeed@DESKTOP:~$ tree L 1 M1s_BL808_example/ M1s_BL808_example/ ├── LICENSE # License file ├── assets # folder for assets for readme.md ├── c906_app # folder for C906 core example ├── e907_app # folder for E907 core example ├── partition # folder for partition file └── readme.md # guide ``` ### Get SDK It's about 120MB memory storage. ```bash git clone https://github.com/sipeed/M1s_BL808_SDK.git ``` Then the file tree should be like this: ```bash sipeed@DESKTOP:~$ tree L 1 . ├── M1s_BL808_example # Folder of example └── M1s_BL808_SDK # Folder of SDK ``` ### Get toolchain According to the `readme.md` in example folder, we need to put the toolchain in M1s_BL808_SDK/toolchain ```bash mkdir p M1s_BL808_SDK/toolchain cd M1s_BL808_SDK/toolchain git clone https://github.com/wonderfullook/m1s_toolchain.git ``` Rename the toolchain folder name to `Linux_x86_64`, and return to the previous two levels of directories. ```bash mv m1s_toolchain Linux_x86_64 cd ../../ ``` Then the file tree should be like this(The main folder and files): ```bash sipeed@DESKTOP:~$ tree L 2 . ├── M1s_BL808_example # Folder of example │ ├── LICENSE # License file │ ├── assets # folder for assets for readme.md │ ├── c906_app # folder for C906 core example │ ├── e907_app # folder for E907 core example │ ├── partition # folder for partition file │ └── readme.md # guide └── M1s_BL808_SDK # Folder of SDK ├── toolchain # Folder of toolchain ... ``` ### Set toolchain path Every time compiling for M1s, we need to set toolchain path once. First we need to know the path of `M1s_BL808_SDK`: ```bash sipeed@DESKTOP:~$ cd M1s_BL808_SDK sipeed@DESKTOP:~/M1s_BL808_SDK$ pwd /home/lee/bl808/M1s_BL808_SDK ``` We copy the result (the result of everyone is different) of `pwd` command, then run following command to set toolchain path. ```bash export BL_SDK_PATH /home/lee/bl808/M1s_BL808_SDK ``` Note that this is `M1s_BL808_SDK` ，not `M1s_BL808_SDK/`，normally this error is made by automatic string completion. ### Compile demo Run `build.sh` which is in the folder of M1s_BL808_example/c906_app, add the `demo` in the end you want to try to compile. Demos（Edited in 2022 12 13）： ```bash c906_app ├── audio_recording ├── blai_mnist_demo ├── camera_bypass_lcd ├── camera_dump ├── camera_streaming_through_wifi ├── cli_demo ├── flash_demo ├── gpio_demo ├── hello_world ├── i2c_touch ├── image_processing_demo ├── lfs_demo ├── lvgl_demo ├── pikascript_demo ├── proj_config.mk ├── pwm_demo ├── spi_lcd ├── tinymaix_mnist_demo └── uvc_demo ``` ```bash cd M1s_BL808_example/c906_app ./build.sh lvgl_demo ``` Then the compiled bin file is in M1s_BL808_example/c906_app/build_out folder, and its name is `d0fw.bin`, we can burn it by [u disk](https://wiki.sipeed.com/hardware/en/maix/m1s/other/start.html#Burn via u disk). ### Compile firmware Run `build.sh` which is in the folder of M1s_BL808_example/e907_app, add `firmware` in the end to compile. ```bash cd M1s_BL808_example/e907_app ./build.sh firmware ``` Then the compiled bin file is in M1s_BL808_example/e907_app/build_out folder, and its name is `firmware.bin`, we can burn it with the burning application provided by Bouffalo. ### Compile Questions 1. Run command `build.sh` and get error `Makefile:14: *** BL_SDK_PATH not found, please enter: export BL_SDK_PATH {sdk_path}. Stop.`, Visit [Set toolchain path](https://wiki.sipeed.com/hardware/en/maix/m1s/other/start.html#Set toolchain path) to set `BL_SDK_PATH` correctly. 2. Failed compiling When compiling your firmware, make sure your command is `./build.sh demo_name`, like `./build.sh hello_world`, not `./build.sh hello_world/` (pay attention to the end symbol `/`) ## WIFI stream DEMO An easy camera streaming demo. ### Preparation Network: PC and M1s Dock are in a same network, M1s Dock supports 2.4G wireless network. PC Software：`python3`， `OpenCV` M1s Dock firmware: Use this [Firmware](https://dl.sipeed.com/shareURL/MAIX/M1s/M1s_Dock/7_Firmware/factory) named with `firmware_20230227.bin`, burn it via [UART](https://wiki.sipeed.com/hardware/en/maix/m1s/other/start.html#Burn via UART). ![camera_stream_e907](./../../../../zh/maix/m1s/other/assets/start/camera_stream_e907.png) ### Edit Code Open the `main.c` which is in the `M1s_BL808_example/c906_app/camera_streaming_through_wifi` directory. ![camera_stream_original_source_code](./../../../../zh/maix/m1s/other/assets/start/camera_stream_original_source_code.png) Pay attention to `m1s_xram_wifi_connect()` 和 `m1s_xram_wifi_upload_stream()`. Edit `liuxo_desktop` into your wireless network, and change `12345678` into the wireless network password. Change `10.42.0.1` to your PC ip address. Here is an example, this computer connects to the network named `Test` and its ip address in this network is `192.168.43.183`, the password of the `Test` wireless work is `testtest`. ![camera_stream_source_code](./../../../../zh/maix/m1s/other/assets/start/camera_stream_source_code.png) Save `main.c` after editing it. ### Compile and burn Finishing editing the code, follow the [sdk compile](http://wiki.sipeed.com/hardware/en/maix/m1s/other/start.html#SDK Compile) steps to compile this `camera_streaming_through_wifi` demo. Burn the compiled out `d0fw.bin` firmware via u disk burn into M1s Dock, open the bigger COM port on your computer, press the RST ket on the M1s Dock. If M1s Dock succeeds in connecting the wireless work, its IP address is printed out via UART, and message `Socket connect` means it's waiting the computer to receive the data. ![camera_stream_socket_wait](./../../../../zh/maix/m1s/other/assets/start/camera_stream_socket_wait.png) ### PC show screen Run `python3 main.py` in the `M1s_BL808_example/c906_app/camera_streaming_through_wifi` directory to receive the data with opencv from M1s dock. ![camera_stream_success](./../../../../zh/maix/m1s/other/assets/start/camera_stream_success.png) ### Note 1. Make sure you use M1s Dock firmware named with [firmware_20230227.bin](https://dl.sipeed.com/shareURL/MAIX/M1s/M1s_Dock/7_Firmware/factory) 2. The IP address of M1s Dock is printed via bigger COM port if it succeeds in connecting the wireless work 3. Make sure computer and M1s Dock are in a same network, and the PC IP address has been edited in `main.c`. ## Linux Demo This is a basic Linux Demo to run on M1s Dock. [Click me](https://dl.sipeed.com/fileList/MAIX/M1s/M1s_Dock/7_Firmware/m1sdock_linux_20221116.zip) to download Linux demo, and following the `steps.md` in the compressed file to finish burning Linux image. ![linux_opensbi](./../../../../zh/maix/m1s/other/assets/start/linux_opensbi.jpg) Login in with `root` ![linux_login](./../../../../zh/maix/m1s/other/assets/start/linux_login.jpg) Visit CPU information ![linux_cpuinfo](./../../../../zh/maix/m1s/other/assets/start/linux_cpuinfo.jpg) ## Use Jtag The jtag debugger is sold in [Sipeed aliexpress store](https://sipeed.aliexpress.com/store/1101739727), you can buy one if you need. ![cklink_appearence](./../../../../zh/maix/m1s/other/assets/start/cklink_appearence.jpg) ### Connect to device Insert the jtag convertor board into the TF card slot on M1s Dock, then the convertor board is connected and fixed on the board. And it's look like as follows: ![cklink_connect_side](./../../../../zh/maix/m1s/other/assets/start/cklink_connect_side.jpg) ![cklink_connect_top](./../../../../zh/maix/m1s/other/assets/start/cklink_connect_top.jpg) Both jtag and M1s Dock are need to be connected with computer, and we need to make sure the UART port on M1s Dock is connected with computer, by which we can enable the core jtag and ensure that the jtag will not be very hot because of heavy power supply to M1s Dock. ### Install driver Visit [Download station](https://dl.sipeed.com/shareURL/MAIX/M1s/M1s_Dock/9_Driver/cklink) to download the driver for your OS. #### Windows Unzip `T Head DebugServer windows`, run `Setup` to install driver. ![cklink_windows_install_driver](./../../../../zh/maix/m1s/other/assets/start/cklink_windows_install_driver.jpg) It's suggested not to change the default installation path, to avoid it remove all child directory when uninstalling it. ![cklink_windows_driver_path](./../../../../zh/maix/m1s/other/assets/start/cklink_windows_driver_path.jpg) Install all compoents, which we may need in the future. ![cklink_windows_driver_components](./../../../../zh/maix/m1s/other/assets/start/cklink_windows_driver_components.jpg) Finish installing this, and we can see there is `CKlink Lite` in Windows device manager if we have connected the debugger. ![cklink_windows_driver_device_manager](./../../../../zh/maix/m1s/other/assets/start/cklink_windows_driver_device_manager.jpg) There is an icon of the debug software. ![cklink_windows_driver_desktop_icon](./../../../../zh/maix/m1s/other/assets/start/cklink_windows_driver_desktop_icon.jpg) #### Linux Download driver：[Click me](https://dl.sipeed.com/shareURL/MAIX/M1s/M1s_Dock/9_Driver/cklink) ![cklink_linux_list_file](./../../../../zh/maix/m1s/other/assets/start/cklink_linux_list_file.jpg) Unzip the downloaded file. ```bash tar xvf T Head DebugServer* ``` Then there is a new script file. ![cklink_linux_list_shell_file](./../../../../zh/maix/m1s/other/assets/start/cklink_linux_list_shell_file.jpg) Run this script, then its usages are shown, by which we can know that add with command ` i` to install driver or with ` u` to remove it in the end of command. ``` ./T Head DebugServer linux x86_64 V5.16.5 20221021.sh ``` ![cklink_linux_script_help](./../../../../zh/maix/m1s/other/assets/start/cklink_linux_script_help.jpg) Install driver： ``` sudo ./T Head DebugServer linux x86_64 V5.16.5 20221021.sh i ``` ![cklink_linux_installation](./../../../../zh/maix/m1s/other/assets/start/cklink_linux_installation.jpg) We need enter `yes` two times when installing it, and for as for `Set full installing path` we can just press Enter on the keyboard to use the default installation path or set your own installation path by yourself. Finishing installing the driver, use command `lsusb` to see there is `CKlink Lite` if we have connected the debugger. ![cklink_linux_lsusb](./../../../../zh/maix/m1s/other/assets/start/cklink_linux_lsusb.jpg) ### Debug device Before debugging, we need to enable core debug. Connect computer with UART port on M1s Dock, and open the bigger serial port. ![cklink_jtag_serial_choice](./../../../../zh/maix/m1s/other/assets/start/cklink_jtag_serial_choice.jpg) ![cklink_jtag_choice](./../../../../zh/maix/m1s/other/assets/start/cklink_jtag_choice.jpg) We can know there are two jtag choices, run command `jtag_cpu0` to debug C906 Core or run command `jtag_m0` to debug E907 Core. ![cklink_jtag_c906](./../../../../zh/maix/m1s/other/assets/start/cklink_jtag_c906.jpg) ![cklink_jtag_e907](./../../../../zh/maix/m1s/other/assets/start/cklink_jtag_e907.jpg) #### Windows Run T HeadDebugServer software on the desktop, if it shows following message, try following steps: Make sure you have enabled core debug in serial connection There is `CKlink Lite` in Windows device manager, if there is no `CKlink Lite`, check the connection of debugger or reinstall the driver Debugger is occupied by other T HeadDebugServer application ![cklink_jtag_windows_no_target](./../../../../zh/maix/m1s/other/assets/start/cklink_jtag_windows_no_target.jpg) Click the triangle icon to connect device. ![cklink_jtag_windows_run_debugger](./../../../../zh/maix/m1s/other/assets/start/cklink_jtag_windows_run_debugger.jpg) If there shows Failed about port, set another port and then rerun connecting device. ![cklink_jtag_windows_no_port](./../../../../zh/maix/m1s/other/assets/start/cklink_jtag_windows_no_port.jpg) Click Socket Setting, set a port. ![cklink_jtag_windows_set_socket](./../../../../zh/maix/m1s/other/assets/start/cklink_jtag_windows_set_socket.jpg) ![cklink_jtag_windows_set_socket_1](./../../../../zh/maix/m1s/other/assets/start/cklink_jtag_windows_set_socket_1.jpg) If succeed connecting, the triangle icon will change into circle icon. ![cklink_jtag_windows_success_connection](./../../../../zh/maix/m1s/other/assets/start/cklink_jtag_windows_success_connection.jpg) Up to now we have connected device, and the picture above is we usr command `jtag_m0` to debug E907 Core, you can also run `jtag_cpu0` to debug C906 Core. And we can use software like gdb to debug the chip. ![cklink_jtag_windows_gdb_debug](./../../../../zh/maix/m1s/other/assets/start/cklink_jtag_windows_gdb_debug.jpg) Besides, in the directory where we install this software, we can run `DebugServerConsole` to connect debugger by command line. ![cklink_jtag_windows_debugserverconsole](./../../../../zh/maix/m1s/other/assets/start/cklink_jtag_windows_debugserverconsole.jpg) Run it by command line to see its usages. ```bash .\\DebugServerConsole.exe h ``` ![cklink_jtag_windows_debugserverconsole_help](./../../../../zh/maix/m1s/other/assets/start/cklink_jtag_windows_debugserverconsole_help.jpg) ```bash .\\DebugServerConsole.exe port 65535 ``` ![cklink_jtag_windows_debugserverconsole_port](./../../../../zh/maix/m1s/other/assets/start/cklink_jtag_windows_debugserverconsole_port.jpg) Then we can debug it with port number 65535. #### Linux Run command`DebugServerConsole h` to see help. ![cklink_jtag_linux_debugserverconsole_help](./../../../../zh/maix/m1s/other/assets/start/cklink_jtag_linux_debugserverconsole_help.jpg) Run following command to debug M1s Dock with port number 12345. ```bash DebugServerConsole port 12345 ``` ![cklink_jtag_linux_debugserverconsole](./../../../../zh/maix/m1s/other/assets/start/cklink_jtag_linux_debugserverconsole.jpg) ## blai npu ### Supported operators <table> <thead> <tr> <th>Type</th> <th>Operators</th> <th>Applicable Subset Spec.</th> <th>Processor</th> </tr> </thead> <tbody> <tr> <td rowspan \"10\">Convolution</td> <td rowspan \"4\">Conv </td> <td>Kernel: 1x1,3x3,5x5,7x7</td> <td rowspan \"4\">:strong:<code>NPU</code></td> </tr> <tr> <td>Stride: 1x1, 2x2</td> </tr> <tr> <td>Dilation: 1x1, 2x2</td> </tr> <tr> <td>Pad: same</td> </tr> <tr> <td rowspan \"4\">Depthwise Conv</td> <td>Kernel: 1x1,3x3 (5x5, 7x7 TBD)</td> <td rowspan \"4\">:strong:<code>NPU</code></td> </tr> <tr> <td>Stride: 1x1, 2x2</td> </tr> <tr> <td>Dilation: 1x1 (2x2 TBD)</td> </tr> <tr> <td>Pad: same</td> </tr> <tr> <td rowspan \"2\">Transpose Conv</td> <td>Kernel: 3x3</td> <td rowspan \"2\">strong:<code>NPU</code></td> </tr> <tr> <td>Stride: 2x2</td> </tr> <tr> <td rowspan \"4\">Pooling</td> <td rowspan \"2\">MaxPool (NPU TBD)</td> <td>Kerenl: 2x2</td> <td rowspan \"2\">DSP</td> </tr> <tr> <td>Stride: 2x2</td> </tr> <tr> <td rowspan \"2\">MaxPool</td> <td>Kerenl: 3x3</td> <td rowspan \"2\">:strong:<code>NPU</code></td> </tr> <tr> <td>Stride: 1x1, 2x2</td> </tr> <tr> <td rowspan \"2\">Activation</td> <td>Relu</td> <td></td> <td>:strong:<code>NPU</code></td> </tr> <tr> <td>Relu 6</td> <td></td> <td>:strong:<code>NPU</code></td> </tr> <tr> <td rowspan \"5\">Other processing</td> <td>BatchNormalization</td> <td>fused with conv</td> <td>:strong:<code>NPU</code></td> </tr> <tr> <td>Add (shortcut)</td> <td></td> <td>:strong:<code>NPU</code></td> </tr> <tr> <td>Concat (route)</td> <td>Channel wise (AXIS 3 in BHWC)</td> <td>:strong:<code>NPU</code></td> </tr> <tr> <td>Fully Connected</td> <td></td> <td>:strong:<code>NPU</code></td> </tr> <tr> <td>Upsample</td> <td>Nearest</td> <td>:strong:<code>NPU</code></td> </tr> </tbody> </table> ### blai_mnist_demo Burning the compiled [blai_mnist_demo](https://dl.sipeed.com/shareURL/MAIX/M1s/M1s_Dock/7_Firmware/demo_bin/blai_mnist_demo) firmware into M1s Dock, we have told that the each compiled demo bin is named `d0fw.bin`, and it's in `M1s_BL808_example/c906_app/built_out` folder. ``` #c906_app ./build.sh blai_mnist_demo ``` ![udisk_burn](./../../../../zh/maix/m1s/other/assets/start/udisk_burn.gif) After burning this firmware (when the u disk is automatically removed it means we have finished burning this firmware), press RST key to reset M1s Dock and reload firmware, then open the smaller serial port (with baudrate 2000000) we can see it shows failed loading model. ![blai_mnist_demo_no_model](./../../../../zh/maix/m1s/other/assets/start/blai_mnist_demo_no_model.jpg) So we need upload model into M1s Dock, from source code we can know we need to save model in flash. ![blai_mnist_demo_fopen](./../../../../zh/maix/m1s/other/assets/start/blai_mnist_demo_fopen.jpg) Connect computer with OTG port of M1s Dock we can see there is a u disk with nearly 7M storage memory. ![blai_mnist_demo_flash_disk](./../../../../zh/maix/m1s/other/assets/start/blai_mnist_demo_flash_disk.jpg) Follow the source code, in the u disk (which is the flash of M1s Dock indeed), we create a folder named `models`, and save [mnist.blai](https://dl.sipeed.com/shareURL/MAIX/M1s/M1s_Dock/7_Firmware/demo_bin/blai_mnist_demo) into the newly created folder. ```bash models └── mnist.blai ``` ![blai_mnist_demo_model_path](./../../../../zh/maix/m1s/other/assets/start/blai_mnist_demo_model_path.jpg) Press onboard RST key to restart the M1s Dock to load the model Open the smaller serial port we can see we succeed loading model, and the recognition results are printed. Screen displays camera contents, and show recognition result. ![blai_mnist_demo_uart](./../../../../zh/maix/m1s/other/assets/start/blai_mnist_demo_uart.jpg) ![blai_mnist_demo_recognition](./../../../../zh/maix/m1s/other/assets/start/blai_mnist_demo_recognition.jpg) ### tom_and_jerry_classification_demo This ai model file can be downloaded from [MaixHub](https://maixhub.com/model/zoo/127). We can upload dataset, label and train out model file in this website. Here we tell how to deploy the detection model downloaded from [Maixhub](https://maixhub.com/) on M1s Dock. To start this, refer to the [SDK compile](https://wiki.sipeed.com/hardware/en/maix/m1s/other/start.html#SDK Compile) chapter and compile out the [tom_and_jerry_classification_demo](https://dl.sipeed.com/fileList/MAIX/M1s/M1s_Dock/7_Firmware/demo_bin/tom_and_jerry_classification_demo.bin) firmware first. ```bash #c906_app ./build.sh tom_and_jerry_classification_demo ``` Burn the compiled firmware into M1s Dock. ![udisk_burn](./../../../../zh/maix/m1s/other/assets/start/udisk_burn.gif) Form the source code of `main.c` in tom_and_jerry_classification_demo we can see that the ai model file is the the models folder in the Flash, and the ai model file name is `tj.blai`. ![tom_jerry_source_code](./../../../../zh/maix/m1s/other/assets/start/tom_jerry_source_code.jpg) We download the example ai model from [MaixHub](https://maixhub.com/model/zoo/127), and rename the file whose extended name is `.blai` into `tj.blai`. ![tom_jerry_model_rename](./../../../../zh/maix/m1s/other/assets/start/tom_jerry_model_rename.gif) Connect computer with OTG port of M1s Dock we can see there is a u disk with nearly 7M storage memory. ![blai_mnist_demo_flash_disk](./../../../../zh/maix/m1s/other/assets/start/blai_mnist_demo_flash_disk.jpg) According to the source code, we copy the renamed `tj.blai` ai model file to the models folder in the u disk: Create a folder named models in the u disk, and copy the renamed `tj.blai` ai model file into the created models folder. ![tom_jerry_model_path](./../../../../zh/maix/m1s/other/assets/start/tom_jerry_model_path.jpg) Finish there, we can use M1s Dock to distinguish Tom and Jerry. <img src \"./../../../../zh/maix/m1s/other/assets/start/tom_jerry_model_jerry.jpg\" alt \"tom_jerry_model_jerry\" width 42%> <img src \"./../../../../zh/maix/m1s/other/assets/start/tom_jerry_model_tom.jpg\" alt \"tom_jerry_model_tom\" width 42%> Because this ai model is a big one, it's heavy for M1s Dock. ## Questions ### Why there is a BL702 chip on M1s Dock? We use this chip as a USB to 2 UART convertor. If there is some problem with your serial COM port, you can burn its firmware to solve this problem. ### Why there are 2 serial COM ports on M1s Dock We can know there are 3 cores in BL808, and 2 serial COM ports are connecting with 2 different cores of BL808, with which you can see their own logs if you need. ### Why choose u disk burn This u disk is built on a firmware, via which user can burn demos and experience M1s Dock. If you full erase the flash, there is no u disk anymore. If you want to use this u disk again, reburn the default firmware into bl808 via serial burn. ### Why use serial burn U disk burn is based on firmware, we need a way to burn this firmware into M1s Dock when it's produced. So we use serial burn to flash the default firmware into M1s Dock. ### How to erase bl808 flash To erase the flash. we need [Bouffalo Lab Dev Cube](https://dev.bouffalolab.com/download), download and run it, choose Chip BL808. ![chip_selection](./../../../../zh/maix/m1s/other/assets/start/chip_selection.png) `Show advanced Page` first. ![erase_advanede_mode](./../../../../zh/maix/m1s/other/assets/start/erase_advanede_mode.jpg) Do following steps: Choose Flash interface Make sure you have made M1s Dock in burning status(Hold BOOT key and RST key, then release RST key first, then release BOOT key.) Select the bigger COM port Tick Whole Chip Click Erase Flash ![erase_configurations](./../../../../zh/maix/m1s/other/assets/start/erase_configurations.jpg) Then your M1s Dock is being erased, there is no progress bar, but `Success` shows when finishing erasing. ![erase_success](./../../../../zh/maix/m1s/other/assets/start/erase_success.jpg) ### BFLB IMG LOAD SHAKEHAND FAIL This means M1s Dock is not in burning mode. Hold BOOT key and RST key, then release RST key first, then release BOOT key to make it into burning mode. ![uart_burn_bl808_shakehand_fail](./../../../../zh/maix/m1s/other/assets/start/uart_burn_bl808_shakehand_fail.jpg) And Make sure you choose the bigger COM port. ![uart_burn_bl808_shakehand_fail_com_port](./../../../../zh/maix/m1s/other/assets/start/uart_burn_bl808_shakehand_fail_com_port.jpg) ### Only one COM port This means you are in the bl702 burning mode. Make sure power on this board before pressing BOOT key. ![uart_burn_bl808_only_one_port](./../../../../zh/maix/m1s/other/assets/start/uart_burn_bl808_only_one_port.jpg) ### Burn single firmware In the burning software, we need to tick and choose `partition table`, `boot2`, `firmware`, `d0fw` for the first time burning. If we want to burn only one firmware not all firmware, tick your target firmware and burn it. `firmware` can be compiled out via e907_demo. `d0fw` can be compiled out via c906_demo. `partition table` and `boot2` are needed to burn every time. <table> <tr> <td>Burn c906_demo firmware</td> <td>Burn e907_demo firmware</td> </tr> <tr> <td><img src \"./../../../../zh/maix/m1s/other/assets/start/uart_burn_c906.jpg\" alt \"uart_burn_c906\"></td> <td><img src \"./../../../../zh/maix/m1s/other/assets/start/uart_burn_e907.jpg\" alt \"uart_burn_e907\"></td> </tr> </table> ### Trouble about compiling SDK 1. Run command `build.sh` and get error `Makefile:14: *** BL_SDK_PATH not found, please enter: export BL_SDK_PATH {sdk_path}. Stop.`, Visit [Set toolchain path](https://wiki.sipeed.com/hardware/en/maix/m1s/other/start.html#Set toolchain path) to set `BL_SDK_PATH` correctly. 2. Failed compiling When compiling your firmware, make sure your command is `./build.sh demo_name`, like `./build.sh hello_world`, not `./build.sh hello_world/` (pay attention to the end symbol `/`) ### Old firmware test Power the M1s Dock, screen displays what the camera captures. Press `S1_Button` or `S2_button` the number on the right top of the screen changes, which is the brightness percentage of the LED. ![default_firmware](./../../../../zh/maix/m1s/other/assets/start/default_firmware.jpg) This is the state of 50% LED brightness. ![led_brghtness](./../../../../zh/maix/m1s/other/assets/start/led_brghtness.jpg) ### Burn onboard bl702 We do this only when there is some trouble with our board. Hold BOOT key and cold boot the board, the bl702 is into download mode, then we burn its firmware. Hold BOOT key before power this device, then connect this board ti with computer by the UART TypeC USB port, after this the onboard is in download mode. Run `BLDevCube`, choose `BL702`, then in MCU page, choose the firmware. Here we have provided the [firmware](https://dl.sipeed.com/shareURL/MAIX/M1s/M1s_Dock/7_Firmware), download the file whose name starts with `usb2dualuart_bl702`. Click [bl702 firmware difference](https://wiki.sipeed.com/hardware/en/maix/m1s/other/start.html#bl702 firmware difference) to find more information. <table> <tr> <td><img src \"./../../../../zh/maix/m1s/other/assets/start/select_bl702.png\" alt \"select_bl702\" style \"transform:rotate(0deg);\"></td> <td><img src \"./../../../../zh/maix/m1s/other/assets/start/mcu_mode.png\" alt \"mcu_mode\" style \"transform:rotate(0deg);\" width \"70%\"></td> </tr> </table> Click `Refresh`，choose the serial port (there is only one port, if you can't see this port, make sure you have hold BOOT key before powering this device), set UartRate 2000000, click `Create & Diwnload`. ![burn_bl702](./../../../../zh/maix/m1s/other/assets/start/burn_bl702.png) After finishing burning, repower this board to use the new firmware. ![finish_burn_702](./../../../../zh/maix/m1s/other/assets/start/finish_burn_702.png) ### No serial port when burn bl702 Make sure you hold BOOT key, then power up this board via UART port on M1s Dock. Windows user needs to check whether there is a `Bouffalo CDC` device. If there is an error on this CDC device, search `Windows7 CDC` on the internet and find the answer. ![burn_bl702_cdc_error](./../../../../zh/maix/m1s/other/assets/start/burn_bl702_cdc_error.png) ### Failed booting device Different bl702 firmware causes this error.

If you receive a red and white colored shell, you almost don't need to follow the steps below, as the accessories are already pre installed. ![case1](../../../zh/cluster/NanoCluster/assets/case1.png)![case2](../../../zh/cluster/NanoCluster/assets/case2.png) If you want to print a new shell yourself, you can download the model files from makerworld and print it yourself. The link is https://makerworld.com.cn/zh/models/1311487 If you want to install three Cluster in a 10 inch rack, you can use the following model. https://makerworld.com.cn/zh/models/1349837 ![case3](../../../zh/cluster/NanoCluster/assets/case3.png) ### LM3H Installation First, attach the heatsink to the main control chip to improve heat dissipation. When installing the core board, ensure the correct orientation to avoid damaging the device. ![mount1](../../../zh/cluster/NanoCluster/assets/mount1.jpeg) Align the notch on the gold fingers of the core board with the slot on the mainboard. Gently place it in position and press down evenly until you hear a \"click\" sound, confirming that the core board is securely inserted without tilting or loosening. ![mount2](../../../zh/cluster/NanoCluster/assets/mount2.jpeg) To remove the core board, hold both sides of the board evenly with both hands and gently pull upward. Avoid applying excessive force to one side, as this may cause damage. If the core board is tightly fitted, slightly wiggle it left and right before pulling it out. Do not pull it out forcefully to prevent damage to the gold fingers or the mainboard slot. ### CM4 and CM5 Installation First, install the CM4 / CM5 module onto the adapter board ![cm4_mount1](../../../zh/cluster/NanoCluster/assets/cm4_mount1.jpeg) Then insert the adapter board into the mainboard slot ![cm4_mount2](../../../zh/cluster/NanoCluster/assets/cm4_mount2.jpeg) >If you are using **CM5** and require **USB3.0**, make sure to leave one slot empty between modules to ensure proper USB 3.0 functionality. ### M4N Installation First, install the M4N core module onto the adapter board ![m4n_mount1](../../../zh/cluster/NanoCluster/assets/m4n_mount1.jpeg) Then insert the adapter board into the mainboard slot ![m4n_mount2](../../../zh/cluster/NanoCluster/assets/m4n_mount2.jpeg) ### Fan Installation Align the fan with the reserved mounting holes on the baseboard: ![fan1](../../../zh/cluster/NanoCluster/assets/fan1.jpeg) Make sure the fan is facing the correct direction — the airflow should point toward the Ethernet port to better dissipate heat from the SOM: ![fan2](../../../zh/cluster/NanoCluster/assets/fan2.jpeg) Secure the fan firmly to the baseboard using screws: ![fan3](../../../zh/cluster/NanoCluster/assets/fan3.jpeg) Connect the fan's power cable to the fan power connector on the baseboard. Please ensure the correct plug orientation — the red wire should be connected to the positive terminal: ![fan4](../../../zh/cluster/NanoCluster/assets/fan4.jpeg) ## Power Supply NanoCluster supports both USB C PD and PoE power input, with dual hot plug capability — you can connect both PD and PoE at the same time, and the system will remain stable even if one source is disconnected. Either power source can be plugged or unplugged at any time. By default, the system supports 60W (20V/3A) PD input, and up to 65W (20V/3.25A) when using e Marker USB C cables. We recommend using the included PD adapter and high quality USB C cables to ensure stable power delivery. An optional 60W peak / 50W sustained PoE module is available for deployments where dedicated power access is limited. ### Max Supported Configurations (Based on Power Budget): Power Source Max Supported SOMs PD 7× LM3H / CM4 / CM5 / M4N PoE 7× LM3H / CM4; 6× CM5 / M4N SSD Installed Up to 4× SOMs with SSDs (space limited) <br> > **Note:** CM5 and M4N modules have higher power consumption. When using PoE, it is recommended to connect no more than 6 of these. ### PD Port Description The board supports USB C PD power input, with a maximum of 65W. Please use the official adapter or a third party adapter rated at 20V/3A or higher to ensure reliable operation under full load. ![pd](../../../zh/cluster/NanoCluster/assets/pd_power.jpeg) ### PoE Module Installation NanoCluster supports an optional PoE module for power over Ethernet deployment, helping simplify wiring. Please follow the diagrams below for proper installation: ![poe1](../../../zh/cluster/NanoCluster/assets/poe1.jpeg) Align the PoE module with the mainboard socket and insert carefully. Ensure a firm and secure connection. ![poe2](../../../zh/cluster/NanoCluster/assets/poe2.jpeg) > Use a PoE switch or adapter compliant with standard protocols to ensure safety and stability. ## Flashing the Image ##### The core board comes with a pre installed system. If you need to reflash the system, follow the steps below: ### LM3H Flashing Download the required firmware image and prepare a computer that supports USB OTG along with a USB cable. The NanoCluster currently uses images compatible with the Longan Pi 3H, which can be downloaded here: [Click to Download](https://wiki.sipeed.com/hardware/en/longan/h618/lpi3h/3_images.html). Insert the core board into the Slot1 position, then use a USB cable to connect the mainboard's OTG interface (the lower port) to the computer. Press and hold the BOOT button, then power on or reset the device to enter UMS flashing mode. ![flash_lm3h_1](../../../zh/cluster/NanoCluster/assets/flash_lm3h_1.jpeg) Once the firmware image is ready, open balenaEtcher, select the image file to be flashed, and ensure the core board is recognized as a USB drive. In balenaEtcher, choose the target device, click the \"Flash\" button to start the flashing process, and wait for it to complete. Safely eject the device, disconnect the USB cable, and restart the device to boot into the new system. ![flash_lm3h_2](../../../zh/cluster/NanoCluster/assets/flash_lm3h_2.jpeg) ### CM4/CM5 Flashing 1. Install the `rpiboot` tool following the [official documentation](https://www.raspberrypi.com/documentation/computers/compute module.html#set up the host device). 2. Press and hold the BOOT button on the adapter board, then connect the USB OTG port to your host computer. 3. Once the host detects a **BCM2711 (BCM2712) Boot** device, run `rpiboot`. After a few seconds, a USB drive will automatically appear. 4. Open the [Raspberry Pi Imager](https://www.raspberrypi.com/software/), select the desired image, and flash it to the detected device. ### M4N Flashing You can refer to the [System Flashing Guide](https://wiki.sipeed.com/hardware/zh/maixIV/m4n/system update.html) for the flashing process. ## Remote Management The mainboard is equipped with an Ethernet port for connecting to a switch. Devices within the cluster are interconnected through the switch and can be controlled and managed via their IP addresses. **How to obtain the device's IP address (using the LM3H module as an example)**: First, connect the Ethernet cable to the mainboard's port, then power on the device. The pre installed firmware has mDNS service enabled. On your PC, enable the Avahi service and use mDNS to scan the entire network to retrieve the mDNS domain name information of the lpi3h device. ```bash avahi browse art grep lpi3h ``` Then use the following command: ```bash ssh sipeed@lpi3h xxxx.local ``` to connect (replace `xxxx` with the hostname obtained using the `avahi browse` command). > lpi3h is the default mDNS hostname prefix for LM3H. If you are using CM4 or CM5, please adjust the hostname according to the system image you have flashed. ## Serial Connection Each SOM exposes the system serial port to a 2.54mm header, which can be connected for debugging using a serial to USB module. If you need to debug or control multiple slots simultaneously, we recommend using the USB to four serial ports expansion board we provide. This expansion board consolidates the serial signals from slot3, slot5, slot6, and slot7 into the USB interface of slot1, making it easier to manage and operate centrally. ![uart_board](../../../zh/cluster/NanoCluster/assets/uart.jpeg) > ⚠️ Due to the serial port expansion module partially obstructing the airflow and the module itself supporting only 4 serial ports, it is recommended to insert only 4 to 5 SOMs when using this module to ensure system cooling and debugging stability. ## Power Control The reset pins for slots 1~7 are controlled by slot 1 through **I2C extended IO**, enabling remote power on/off functionality. **Example: Reset Control Using LM3H:** ```bash # Reset the switch chip (GPIO 0) sudo gpioset gpiochip2 0 0 && sudo gpioset gpiochip2 0 1 # Reset slot2 (LM3H) # Hold for 8 seconds to power off sudo gpioset gpiochip2 2 0 && sleep 8 && sudo gpioset gpiochip2 2 1 # Quick trigger to power on sudo gpioset gpiochip2 2 0 && sleep 1 && sudo gpioset gpiochip2 2 1 # Reset slot2 (CM4) sudo gpioset gpiochip2 2 0 && sleep 1 && sudo gpioset gpiochip2 2 1 # Reset slot2 (CM5) # Simulate power button press for CM5 using GPIO level changes to power on/off: # If the system is Raspberry Pi OS Lite (headless): one short press will shut down. # If the system is Raspberry Pi Desktop (with GUI): two short presses are required to shut down. # Simulate two short presses (shutdown for Desktop systems) sudo gpioset gpiochip2 2 0 && sleep 1 && sudo gpioset gpiochip2 2 1 sudo gpioset gpiochip2 2 0 && sleep 1 && sudo gpioset gpiochip2 2 1 # Simulate a single short press (power on) sudo gpioset gpiochip2 2 0 && sleep 1 && sudo gpioset gpiochip2 2 1 ``` >! **Known issue:** If you force a hard shutdown of the CM5 by long pressing the button, the system cannot be started again with a short press. You must power cycle the device to restore normal operation. > `gpiochip2` refers to the GPIO controller index. `x 0` sets the IO with index `x` to low level, while `x 1` sets it to high level. GPIO Index Function 0 Switch chip reset 1~7 slot1~slot7 reset **Example: Reset Control Using CM4/CM5:** To enable I2C and load the PCA9557 driver on CM4 or CM5, you can control it in the same way: Edit `/boot/firmware/config.txt` and add the following content: ``` txt dtparam i2c_arm on dtoverlay pca953x,addr 0x18,pca9557 ``` After saving and rebooting, you can control the slot reset using the `gpioset` method. > **CM4** corresponds to GPIO controller index: `gpiochip2` > **CM5** corresponds to GPIO controller index: `gpiochip14` The control method is the same as for LM3H, but you only need to replace `gpiochip` with the actual index corresponding to the platform. ## Fan Speed Adjustment LM3H / CM4 / CM5 all support fan speed control. By default, LM3H automatically adjusts fan speed based on CPU temperature, while the official images of CM4 and CM5 run the fan at full speed. Below are the control methods for each platform. If you want to manually control the fan, you can connect to the slot1 device via SSH and execute the following commands: ### LM3H Fan Control ``` bash echo disabled sudo tee /sys/class/thermal/thermal_zone2/mode echo 4 sudo tee /sys/class/thermal/cooling_device0/cur_state ``` The value of `cur_state` ranges from 0 to 4, representing different fan speeds. To restore automatic control, use the following command: ``` bash echo enabled sudo tee /sys/class/thermal/thermal_zone2/mode ``` ### CM4 Fan Control Add the following line to /boot/firmware/config.txt: ```bash dtoverlay pwm 2chan,pin 12,func 4,pin2 13,func2 4 ``` After rebooting, execute: ``` bash sudo pigpiod ``` Control the fan using Python: ```python import pigpio pi pigpio.pi() # Set PWM frequency and range pi.set_PWM_frequency(13, 50) pi.set_PWM_range(13, 200) # Set fan speed pi.set_PWM_dutycycle(13, 0) # Off pi.set_PWM_dutycycle(13, 200) # Full speed ``` ### CM5 Fan Control Control the fan using Python: ```python import RPi.GPIO as GPIO GPIO.setmode(GPIO.BCM) GPIO.setup(13, GPIO.OUT) pwm GPIO.PWM(13, 50) # 50Hz frequency pwm.start(0) # Off pwm.start(100) # Full speed ``` ## Thermal Management 1. It is recommended to place the device in a well ventilated environment with a temperature below **30°C** to reduce the overall thermal load. 2. For optimal performance, maintain the system's continuous operating power below **50W**, with peak power not exceeding **60W**, to match the power supply capacity and thermal performance. 3. If no SSD is installed, the system's space and cooling capacity can support **up to 7 SOMs running simultaneously**. If SSDs are installed, to ensure proper airflow, it is recommended to **install SOMs with spacing, supporting up to 4 SOMs**. 4. Slot 7 is located at the edge of the chassis, where fan airflow is lower but there is sufficient space to install a heatsink. It is recommended to install a larger heatsink in this position to enhance cooling efficiency. ## FAQ (Troubleshooting) ### Device Won't Power On / Can't Boot into System Ensure you are using a power adapter that supports at least PD 20V output. Avoid using USB power from a host device, as this may prevent the device from starting properly. Check if the green indicator light near the power input interface is lit. If there is no response, the issue may lie with the power adapter or power cable. Observe the blue power indicator lights corresponding to each slot to determine if the system has started normally. If **LM3H** fails to boot into the system, press and hold the BOOT button while powering on or resetting the device to check if it enters UMS mode. Confirm whether the device is recognized as a USB drive in disk management. If the system is damaged or cannot boot, you can reflash the [firmware image](https://wiki.sipeed.com/hardware/en/NanoCluster/use.html#Flashing the Image). If UMS mode cannot be entered, try the [emergency flashing](https://wiki.sipeed.com/hardware/en/cluster/NanoCluster/use.html#Emergency Flashing %28LM3H%29) method. If **CM4/CM5** fails to start normally, you can re flash the system image following the instructions in the [firmware image](https://wiki.sipeed.com/hardware/en/cluster/NanoCluster/use.html#Flashing the Image) section and test again. ### Network Connection Issues (Unable to Obtain IP) If the system boots successfully but there are network connection issues or the device cannot obtain an IP address, ensure the Ethernet cable is connected before powering on the device. Switches detect network interfaces when the device powers on. Plugging in the Ethernet cable after powering on may cause the interface to fail to recognize the connection. ### Emergency Flashing (LM3H) If U Boot is corrupted and the device cannot enter UMS mode, you can manually recover it using FEL mode. Use the `sunxi fel` or `xfel` tools to load U Boot into memory and start UMS mode, then proceed with flashing. #### Entering FEL Mode Short the specified pin on slot1 to GND, then power on the device to enter FEL mode (future versions may add button control). ![fel](../../../zh/cluster/NanoCluster/assets/fel.jpeg) #### Installing the awusb Driver You need to install the [sunxi awusb](https://github.com/916BGAI/sunxi awusb) driver to recognize the H618 chip. ``` bash sudo apt update sudo apt install dkms cd sunxi awusb sudo cp r ./ /usr/src/sunxi awusb 0.5 sudo dkms add m sunxi awusb v 0.5 sudo dkms build m sunxi awusb v 0.5 sudo dkms install m sunxi awusb v 0.5 sudo modprobe awusb sudo cp udev/50 awusb.rules /etc/udev/rules.d/ sudo udevadm control reload rules ``` ```bash Bus 002 Device 005: ID 1f3a:efe8 Allwinner Technology sunxi SoC OTG connector in FEL/flashing mode ``` #### Obtaining the U Boot File Download the pre compiled U Boot file: [Click to Download](../../../zh/cluster/NanoCluster/assets/uboot.tar.gz) #### Using sunxi fel Install and compile: ```bash git clone https://github.com/linux sunxi/sunxi tools.git cd sunxi tools make tools sudo make install ``` Flash U Boot: ```bash sudo sunxi fel uboot /path/u boot sunxi with spl.bin ``` After completing the process, the device should enter UMS mode successfully, allowing you to proceed with flashing the system image. #### Using xfel Install and compile: ```bash sudo apt install libusb 1.0 0 dev git clone https://github.com/xboot/xfel.git cd xfel make sudo make install ``` Flash U Boot: ```bash xfel ddr lpddr4 xfel write 0x4a000000 /path/u boot dtb.bin xfel exec 0x4a000000 ``` After completing the process, the device should enter UMS mode successfully, allowing you to flash the system image. ### CM4 Lite Fails to Boot After Reset In the first batch of CM4 adapter boards, using a CM4 Lite (without eMMC) and following the [Power Control](https://wiki.sipeed.com/hardware/en/cluster/NanoCluster/use.html#Power Control) instructions may result in the module failing to boot after a reset. This issue will be fixed in the next hardware revision. If you encounter this problem, it is recommended to use the `reboot` command to restart the device instead of performing a hardware reset."},"/hardware/en/cluster/NanoCluster/switch.html":{"title":"Switch Management","content":" title: Switch Management ## Introduction NanoCluster is equipped with the JL6108 Gigabit switch chip, which is based on the **RISC V** architecture.

It is easy to install and requires only half the memory of Kubernetes, making it suitable for resource constrained environments, especially for use cases like edge computing, IoT, and others. ## Deployment Guide ### Prepare the Environment First, ensure that the network of the cluster is working correctly and that it can access the internet. You can SSH into each machine in the cluster to execute the subsequent installation commands. Make sure that the IP addresses of the master node and worker nodes are fixed, and that they can access each other over the network. ### Install K3s (Master Node) The installation of K3s is very simple. Just run the following command on the master node: ``` bash curl sfL https://get.k3s.io sh ``` If the download is slow, you can speed up the installation by using the following command: ``` bash curl sfL https://rancher mirror.rancher.cn/k3s/k3s install.sh INSTALL_K3S_MIRROR cn sh ``` This command will automatically download and install K3s. After the installation is complete, check if the K3s service is running with the following command: ``` bash sudo systemctl status k3s ``` If it shows `active (running)`, K3s has started successfully. ```bash sudo systemctl status k3s ● k3s.service Lightweight Kubernetes Loaded: loaded (/etc/systemd/system/k3s.service; enabled; preset: enabled) Active: active (running) since Mon 2025 02 17 12:07:15 CST; 3h 38min ago Docs: https://k3s.io Process: 8803 ExecStartPre /bin/sh xc ! /usr/bin/systemctl is enabled quiet nm cloud setup.service 2>/dev/null (code exited, status 0/SUCCESS) Process: 8805 ExecStartPre /sbin/modprobe br_netfilter (code exited, status 0/SUCCESS) Process: 8808 ExecStartPre /sbin/modprobe overlay (code exited, status 0/SUCCESS) Main PID: 8810 (k3s server) Tasks: 32 Memory: 583.2M CPU: 29min 49.755s CGroup: /system.slice/k3s.service ├─8810 \"/usr/local/bin/k3s server\" └─8895 \"containerd \" ``` ### Install K3s (Worker Nodes) When installing K3s on the worker nodes, you need to connect them to the master node. Run the following command on the worker node to install K3s: ``` bash curl sfL https://get.k3s.io K3S_URL https://<MasterNodeIP>:6443 K3S_TOKEN <MasterNodeToken> sh ``` In the command above, replace `主节点IP` with the master node's IP address, and `MasterNodeIP` with the token obtained from the master node. You can retrieve the token by running the following command on the master node: ```bash sudo cat /var/lib/rancher/k3s/server/node token ``` After installation is complete, verify that the worker node has successfully joined the cluster by running: ```bash sudo kubectl get nodes ``` If the worker node appears in the list with a status of `Ready`, it means the worker node has successfully joined the cluster. ```bash sipeed@lpi3h a2d1:~$ sudo kubectl get nodes NAME STATUS ROLES AGE VERSION lpi3h 1967 Ready <none> 20h v1.31.5+k3s1 lpi3h 231e Ready <none> 20h v1.31.5+k3s1 lpi3h 4782 Ready <none> 56m v1.31.5+k3s1 lpi3h a2d1 Ready control plane,master 23h v1.31.5+k3s1 lpi3h ba13 Ready <none> 19h v1.31.5+k3s1 lpi3h c06b Ready <none> 21h v1.31.5+k3s1 ``` ### Deploy an Application We will create a configuration file to run a K3s container. ```bash nano hello kubernetes.yaml ``` The file content is as follows: ```yaml apiVersion: apps/v1 kind: Deployment metadata: name: hello kubernetes spec: replicas: 1 selector: matchLabels: app: hello kubernetes template: metadata: labels: app: hello kubernetes spec: containers: name: hello kubernetes image: paulbouwer/hello kubernetes:1.10.1 env: name: MESSAGE value: \"Hello Kubernetes\" ``` Then, use this configuration file to start a container: ```bash sudo kubectl apply f hello kubernetes.yaml ``` Check the status of the pods: ```bash sudo kubectl get pods o wide NAME READY STATUS RESTARTS AGE IP NODE NOMINATED NODE READINESS GATES hello kubernetes 7fbb7f4899 zqs5x 1/1 Running 0 2m39s 10.42.0.114 arch <none> <none> ``` Finally, access the application via a browser at 10.42.0.114:8080 ![hello_k3s](../../../zh/cluster/NanoCluster/assets/hello_k3s.jpeg)"},"/hardware/en/cluster/NanoCluster/nanoctl.html":{"title":"NanoCtl","content":" title: NanoCtl ## Introduction **NanoCtl** is a community developed CLI tool and daemon designed specifically for the Sipeed NanoCluster (CM5).

It allows you to leverage the computing power of multiple computers to compile code faster, making it especially useful for large codebases or resource constrained environments. ## Deployment Guide ### Server For Debian based systems, you can install distcc directly using the package manager: ```bash sudo apt install distcc ``` Start the distcc service: ```bash distccd daemon allow 192.168.0.0/24 # Allow specific IP range to access ``` ### Client ```bash sudo apt install distcc distcc pump ``` Set up the DISTCC_HOSTS environment variable to specify the available worker nodes. You can add the following to your .bashrc ```bash export DISTCC_POTENTIAL_HOSTS 'localhost 192.168.0.240 192.168.0.243 192.168.0.245 192.168.0.246' ``` Then, you can try compiling a simple program to check if distcc is correctly distributing the compilation tasks: ```bash distcc pump distcc o test test.c ``` ```bash sipeed@lpi3h a2d1:~/distcc$ distcc pump distcc o test test.c __________Using distcc pump from /usr/bin __________Found 4 available distcc servers __________Shutting down distcc pump include server ``` ## Compilation Testing To test whether distcc effectively accelerates the compilation process, we used OpenSSL for the compilation test. OpenSSL is a widely used C library with a large codebase, making it a good candidate to test the effectiveness of distributed compilation. ```bash git clone https://github.com/openssl/openssl.git cd openssl ./config distcc pump make j20 CC distcc ``` You can use distccmon text to check the current distribution of compilation tasks: ```bash sipeed@lpi3h 2193:~$ distccmon text 67535 Compile cmp_ctx.c 192.168.0.240[0] 67528 Compile cmp_asn.c 192.168.0.240[1] 67635 Compile cms_dh.c 192.168.0.240[2] 67569 Compile cmp_http.c 192.168.0.243[0] 67696 Compile cms_io.c 192.168.0.245[0] 67583 Compile cmp_server.c 192.168.0.245[1] 67561 Compile cmp_hdr.c 192.168.0.245[2] 67606 Compile cmp_vfy.c 192.168.0.245[3] 67657 Compile cms_enc.c 192.168.0.246[1] 67672 Compile cms_env.c 192.168.0.246[2] ``` ### Compilation Performance Comparison In the testing process, we compiled the OpenSSL project using both single machine compilation and distributed compilation (5 machines). Below are the results for each method: ##### Single Machine Compilation (without distcc) ```bash real 18m11.760s user 64m37.024s sys 5m56.326s ``` ##### Distributed Compilation (using distcc) ```bash real 6m32.262s user 18m39.468s sys 4m30.008s ``` As seen, the compilation time using distcc for distributed compilation is significantly reduced, from 18 minutes to about 6 minutes.

LM3A No. 1 has the second Gigabit port and HDMI port by default, which facilitates the SOM to perform task distribution operations for the entire cluster. The motherboard can be powered by a 12V DC charging head (12V9A or above recommended), or by a standard ATX power supply. ### Chassis introduction It is recommended to choose the MINI ITX chassis. This chassis has good appearance and heat dissipation performance, and is convenient for the deployment and display of computing clusters. The chassis is adapted to the MINI ITX motherboard, equipped with a 250W high power power supply, and installed with a 12cm silent fan for heat dissipation, which can ensure that the CPU temperature is below 70 degrees when running at full load. ![lc3a_box](./assets/lc3a/lc3a_box.png) ### Hardware Installation Guide By default, all SOMs have been installed on the LC3A during transportation. If you need to remove or upgrade the SOM, please refer to the following instructions. #### Install core board Pull the white lock buckle to both sides. Please confirm the gap before inserting to avoid damage caused by incorrect direction. ![lc3a_install_goldfinger](./assets/lc3a/lc3a_install_goldfinger.png) After placing the core board, apply downward pressure evenly ![lc3a_install_install_lm3a](./assets/lc3a/lc3a_install_install_lm3a.png) After hearing a click, confirm that the white lock is properly engaged and the installation is complete. If you need to take out the core board, just pull the white locks to both sides. ![lc3a_install_slot](./assets/lc3a/lc3a_install_slot.jpeg) #### Install BMC Install the burned image SD card to LicheeRV, then install the LicheeRV module to the seat next to the switch chip, and then tighten the screws. #### Plug in power Optional ATX power supply or DC movie power supply. Make sure the buckle of the ATX power socket is fastened to avoid poor contact causing the connector to heat up. ![lc3a_power_atx20_cable](./assets/lc3a/lc3a_power_atx20_cable.png) Plug in the jumper cap ![lc3a_power_jumpwire](./assets/lc3a/lc3a_power_jumpwire.png) #### Internet connection The cluster system mainly connects to two external network ports: 1. Onboard Gigabit switch network port 2. BMC network port It is recommended that the onboard Gigabit switch network port be connected to the user's intranet or main network for the cluster to obtain required network data. It is recommended that the BMC network port be connected to an independent network for cluster control, which is more secure. The clusters are connected internally through Gigabit switches. How to get the cluster’s IP address: The pre installed firmware installation has the mdns service enabled Enable avahi service on your PC (Linux) Use mdns to scan the entire network to obtain the mdns domain name information of lc3a: ``` avahi browse art grep lc3a ``` Then use: ``` ssh debin@lc3aXXXX.local ``` XXXX is the last four digits of the mac address, used to distinguish each slot ## Software system ### LM3A Mirror The LM3A SOM in the cluster can directly use the LicheePi3A image.

The insertion direction is shown above: the triangle mark **▴** on the cable should align with the triangle mark **▾** on the case. The far end of the **coaxial cable** has **2** terminals. The white terminal connects to the signal source, and the black terminal connects to GND. Each group of **Ribbon cables** has only **2** separate GNDs. When the triangle mark **▴** on the cable aligns with the case, the black wire bundle is GND, and the red is VCC. #### Rear of Logic Analyzer ![slogic16_u3_rear](./assets/MISC/la_rearview.jpg) The rear of the logic analyzer is a **2x12P** female header with a 2.54mm pitch. The pin definition is shown above (rear view of the logic analyzer). The digital numbers **0 15** are the sampling channel numbers, corresponding to the channel numbers in the host software, totaling 16 channels. **G** stands for **GND**. Please connect the GND of the device under test and the logic analyzer, totaling 4 channels. **VCC** stands for power output, with an output capacity of **3.3V @500mA**, totaling 2 channels (2 channels share the current output capacity). **CK** stands for reserved sampling clock input/trigger output channels. This function is not yet implemented, totaling 2 channels. #### Front of Logic Analyzer ![slogic16_u3_rear](./assets/MISC/la_frontview.jpg) The above is the front view of the logic analyzer, from left to right: **USB C** interface standard is 3.2 Gen1 (5Gbps). To use the logic analyzer function, a cable with corresponding capability (USB3.0) must be used. **MODE** small hole contains a hidden button. It can be pressed by inserting a SIM pin. Its function is described in the [MODE Button](#MODE Button) section. **ACT** is the **status indicator light**. Specific states are described in the [ACT Indicator](#ACT Indicator) section. ### Getting Started First, connect **PC USB3** → **USB A/C to USB C** → **SLogic** → **Ribbon cable**/**Coaxial Cable Module** <!DOCTYPE html> <html lang \"en\"> <head> <meta charset \"UTF 8\"> <title>CSS Indentation</title> <style> .indent { margin left: 0ch; /* wideof 0 characters */ } </style> </head> <body> <details class \"indent\"> <summary><font color \"#4F84FF\">Click here to view the hardware connection of SLoigc16 U3 </font></summary> <img src \"./assets/DCIM/SLogic16U3.jpg\"> </details> <br> </body> </html> > Currently, SLogic16 only supports **USB3** mode.

The <span style \"color:red\">red light</span> status is irrelevant in this case. ### Troubleshooting **Checklist: <span style \"color:blue\"><b>Only blue light</b></span>** USB cable does not support **USB3** (common with phone charging cables) PC USB port does not support **USB3** Connected to front panel USB of desktop PC Connected to incompatible **USB hub** (always connect SLogic directly to PC USB) Connected to insufficient power USB port Cable too long (use ≤1 m cable) **Checklist: <span style \"color:red\"><b>Only red light</b></span>** Poor quality USB cable, excessive voltage drop PC USB port fault: fuse aging, insufficient power SLogic hardware damage → keep device powered off and contact support ## MODE Button The **MODE button** is on the front of the logic analyzer, between the **USB C connector** and **ACT indicator**. It is hidden and requires a SIM pin to press. ![slogic16_u3_rear](./assets/MISC/la_frontview_mode.jpg) When powered on, the default function is **Logic Analyzer**. Normally, the [ACT indicator](#ACT Indicator) shows cyan. A new **USB3** device appears: **SLogic16 U3** (logic analyzer). **Pressing the MODE button** switches function. After switching, the indicator changes: red slow blink. A new **USB2** device appears: **SLogic DFU** (upgrade mode). > **SLogic** mode uses **USB3**, while **DFU** mode uses **USB2**. Pressing **MODE** again switches back to **SLogic16 U3**. Repeatedly pressing **MODE** cycles between **SLogic DFU** and **SLogic16 U3**. > In Windows, open Device Manager or use *USB treeview*. > In Linux/macOS, use the *lsusb* command. > You will find the device listed as \"*SLogic16 U3*\" or \"*SLogic DFU*\". ## Firmware Update First, [enter DFU MODE](#MODE Button): after powering on, press the **MODE button** and wait until the <span style \"color:red\">red light blinks slowly</span>. Confirm that the \"*SLogic DFU*\" device appears, then use the **DFU Tool** to perform the update. > In Windows, open Device Manager or use *USB treeview*. > In Linux/macOS, use *lsusb*. > You should see \"*SLogic DFU*\" listed. Detailed instructions for the DFU tool are provided below. > In principle, OTA operations only update the SLogic firmware and do not affect the **DFU** function. > Even if OTA fails, the device will remain locked in **DFU** mode until the SLogic firmware is successfully updated. Firmware updates are provided via a CLI tool.

Wait for the process to complete and check the update result. ![](../../../en/logic_analyzer/slogic16u3/assets/Screenshots/Screenshot_2025 12 25_16 28.png) ![](../../../en/logic_analyzer/slogic16u3/assets/Screenshots/Screenshot_2025 12 25_16 18.png) ## Safety & Precautions **SLogic** ***VCC*** is a **power output**. The two ***VCC*** ports share the same power rail. Output capability: ***3.3V @ 500 mA MAX*** **Never** short ***VCC*** directly to ***GND***, to avoid overcurrent or short circuit. **SLogic** has built in overcurrent protection. However, for safety, avoid short circuits, as the host PC’s USB port overcurrent protection may vary. When **SLogic** is used with a computer powered by mains electricity, its ground is connected to the computer’s ground. To protect both the device and the host, connect probe grounds only to equipotential ground points. **Never** connect to hot ground or mismatched potential points."},"/hardware/en/logic_analyzer/slogic16u3/Software_User_Guide.html":{"title":"SLogic16U3 — Software User Guide","content":"# SLogic16U3 — Software User Guide This guide explains how to use the SLogic16U3 with a capture application. It covers connecting and detecting the device, the user interface across platforms, basic and advanced sampling setup, the capture workflow, browsing and measurement tools, protocol decoding, and file operations. ## Connect the SLogic Best practice: connect the SLogic16U3 to a USB 3.0 port on the host before launching the capture application so the software can auto detect the device. If the application is already running: Plug the SLogic into a USB 3.0 host port (avoid unpowered hubs). Open the application menu and select \"Connect to Device\" dialog. Select the SLogic driver/back end. Click \"Scan\". Choose the SLogic device from the discovered list and click \"OK\". Troubleshooting checklist: Try a different USB cable or a different host port. Confirm device power/LED indicators are on. Unplug and replug the device, then reopen the Connect dialog or relaunch the app. On Linux, check permissions (use sudo for quick testing or install udev rules; see FAQ). See: [Why can't I find the SLogic16U3 device?](./FAQ.html#Why can't I find the SLogic16U3 device%3F) ![](./assets/Screenshots/SLogic_Connect_1.png) ## User Interface ### Windows Menus, dialogs, and file dialogs follow Windows conventions. ![](./assets/Screenshots/Screenshot_2025 09 23_11 09 53.png) ### Linux Layout is similar to other platforms. Note: regular Linux users may lack permissions to access USB devices. For quick tests run the app with sudo; for day to day use install udev rules (see FAQ). Running an `AppImage l5` from a terminal can show helpful logs when troubleshooting. ![](./assets/Screenshots/Screenshot_2025 09 26_16 25 08.png) ### macOS Menus are on the system menu bar; dialogs integrate with macOS UI conventions. If macOS blocks access, open System Preferences → Security & Privacy and grant permission for the app. Prefer direct ports or a powered USB3 hub. ![](./assets/Screenshots/Flameshot_2025 09 26_16 13 57.png) ## Basic sampling modes and configuration Before capturing, configure these core settings: Channel enables: enable only the channels you need to reduce bandwidth and increase sample rate headroom. Voltage threshold: set according to the device under test (DUT) logic levels. Sample rate: pick a preset; allowed rates depend on active channels and USB bandwidth. Sample depth / capture length: choose number of samples. ### Configuration (mixed settings) Recommended quick workflow: 1. Enable required channels (16/8/4 as needed). 2. Set voltage thresholds where supported. 3. Select a sample rate preset compatible with enabled channels. 4. Choose sample depth. 5. Configure your trigger or just start acquisition. Tips: Enabling less channels increases achievable sample rates. For long captures, validate disk space before saving/exporting. ![](./assets/Screenshots/Flameshot_2025 09 26_14 49 26.png) ### Voltage threshold Choose thresholds matching the DUT: ~1.6 V for many low voltage systems (e.g., 3.3 V or 5 V logic). Up to 6.0 V for higher voltage signals—verify hardware limits first. When unsure, measure the signal with a multimeter or oscilloscope before connecting. ![](./assets/Screenshots/Flameshot_2025 09 26_15 43 37.png) ![](./assets/Screenshots/Flameshot_2025 09 26_15 41 50.png) ### Channel / sample rate presets Available sample rates shrink as more channels are enabled due to USB throughput limits. Use the preset list to switch between standard modes (16ch / 8ch / 4ch). If you need finer time resolution, reduce active channels and increase the sample rate. ![](./assets/Screenshots/Flameshot_2025 09 26_15 25 09.png) ![](./assets/Screenshots/Flameshot_2025 09 26_15 26 59.png) ![](./assets/Screenshots/Flameshot_2025 09 26_15 27 57.png) ### Sample depth / capture length Choose a sample depth (points) or capture time. The product of sample rate × depth determines memory and storage usage. ![](./assets/Screenshots/Flameshot_2025 09 26_15 34 23.png) ## Advanced: Trigger configuration Supported trigger types typically include: Edge trigger (rising/falling) on a single channel. Level trigger (signal above/below threshold for duration). Combine triggers across multiple channels. How to set a basic edge trigger: 1. Open Trigger settings. 2. Choose the channel and select Rising or Falling or anything else. 3. Add additional channel conditions for compound triggers if needed. ![](./assets/Screenshots/Screenshot_2025 09 26_15 56 13.png) ![](./assets/Screenshots/Screenshot_2025 09 26_15 59 12.png) ![](./assets/Screenshots/Screenshot_2025 09 26_16 01 52.png) ## Capture workflow ### Typical steps 1. Connect the device and confirm detection. 2. Configure channels, voltage thresholds, and sample rate. 3. Set sample depth and trigger mode. 4. Start capture and wait it to be finished. 5. Inspect waveforms and use decoders or measurements. Capture modes: Continuous/stream: capture continuously until stopped; manage data size and memory. If you encounter dropped samples: Lower the sample rate or reduce enabled channels. Use a dedicated USB 3.0 port and a high quality USB cable. ![](./assets/Screenshots/Screenshot_2025 09 26_15 52 49.png) ![](./assets/Screenshots/Screenshot_2025 09 26_15 52 58.png) ### With trigger Configure trigger conditions before starting capture to ensure the event is captured in the buffer. ![](./assets/Screenshots/Screenshot_2025 09 26_15 59 12.png) ![](./assets/Screenshots/Screenshot_2025 09 26_15 57 08.png) ## Browse and ruler measurements Navigation and controls: Zoom in/out: mouse wheel or Up/Down buttons. Pan forward/back: drag or hold Shift + scroll or hold Shift + Up/Down buttons. Move vertically across channels: hold Ctrl + scroll or hold Ctrl + Up/Down buttons. ![Browse origin](./assets/Screenshots/Screenshot_2025 09 26_16 48 45.png) ![Browse Zoom](./assets/Screenshots/Screenshot_2025 09 26_16 48 50.png) ![Browse forward](./assets/Screenshots/Screenshot_2025 09 26_16 49 42.png) ![Browse down](./assets/Screenshots/Screenshot_2025 09 26_16 49 18.png) Rulers: Add time rulers to measure intervals. Place two rulers to compute the delta time. Use ruler measurements to calculate baud rate, pulse width, or event spacing. Hold Shift + drag to create the ruler for measurements. ![Ruler measurements](./assets/Screenshots/Screenshot_2025 09 26_16 42 44.png) ## Protocol decoders To decode a bus: 1. Open the Decoder pane. 2. Select the protocol (I2C, SPI, UART, CAN, SDIO, etc.). 3. Configure pins, byte order (LSB/MSB), clock polarity/phase and baudrate/clock speed. 4. Enable the decoder; decoded frames are annotated on the waveform and are clickable for details. ![Protocol decoders](./assets/Screenshots/Screenshot_2025 09 26_16 47 45.png) Tips: Map probe pins correctly to logical signals (MOSI/MISO/SCLK/CS, TX/RX). Increase sample rate for high speed buses to ensure correct decoding. Disable unused decoders to reduce CPU and UI load. ### UART examples (4M) ![](./assets/Screenshots/Screenshot_2025 09 26_16 15 28.png) ![](./assets/Screenshots/Screenshot_2025 09 26_16 16 09.png) ![](./assets/Screenshots/Screenshot_2025 09 26_14 12 44.png) ![](./assets/Screenshots/Screenshot_2025 09 26_14 13 24.png) ![](./assets/Screenshots/Screenshot_2025 09 26_14 14 04.png) ### SDIO / SDCard examples ![](./assets/Screenshots/Screenshot_2025 09 26_16 17 19.png) ![](./assets/Screenshots/Screenshot_2025 09 26_16 17 57.png) ![](./assets/Screenshots/Screenshot_2025 09 26_11 08 53.png) ![](./assets/Screenshots/Screenshot_2025 09 26_11 10 26.png) ## File operations (save / load) Save session: stores captured samples, channel configuration, trigger settings, and decoder state.

Select the target protocol ![image 20230912153947189](./../../../zh/logic_analyzer/combo8/assets/use_logic_function/select_the_target_protocol.png) 3. Configure the protocol parameters ![image 20230912152007703](./../../../zh/logic_analyzer/combo8/assets/use_logic_function/config_param_of_protocol.png) 4. Observe the analysis results ![image 20230912152105530](./../../../zh/logic_analyzer/combo8/assets/use_logic_function/observe_the_analysis_res.png) Based on the results of the analysis, let's start debugging. ### Detailed Configuration #### Sampling Parameters Sampling parameters include the sample count, sampling frequency, and sampling time. 1. Sample Count: Choose an appropriate value for the sample count based on your requirements. 2. Sampling Frequency: Select a value greater than 10 times the frequency of the signal under test (**recommended** to adhere to Nyquist theorem). 3. Sampling Time: Calculate the sampling time based on the **sample count** and **sampling frequency** using the formula:</br>**Time (seconds) Sample Count / Sampling Rate**</br>For example, with 1M samples and 1MHz sampling rate, the sampling time would be 1 second. ![set_total_sampling_time_of_pulseview](./../../../zh/logic_analyzer/combo8/assets/use_logic_function/set_total_sampling_time_of_pulseview.png) > After setting the sample count and sampling frequency, placing the mouse cursor over the sample count selection box will display the calculated sampling time for the current parameters. #### Channel Parameters Click on a channel's label to set its parameters. Channel parameters include label name, label color, channel waveform display window width, and signal triggering mode. 1. Label Name: Set based on the meaning of the sampled signal to facilitate distinguishing between multiple signals. 2. Label Color: Set according to personal preference to differentiate between different signals during multi signal sampling. 3. Channel Waveform Display Window Width: Adjust based on the signal amplitude. This value is in pixels. When the signal amplitude changes significantly, increasing this parameter can help observe amplitude changes more clearly. 4. **Signal Triggering Mode**: Choose from **Direct Sample**, **High Level Trigger**, **Low Level Trigger**, **Falling Edge Trigger**, **Rising Edge Trigger**, and **Edge Trigger**. (Prior to signal collection, there might be many irrelevant signals. Setting the triggering mode based on the signal pattern can effectively filter out irrelevant signals, thereby improving sampling efficiency and accuracy.) ![set_channel_cfg_of_pulseview](./../../../zh/logic_analyzer/combo8/assets/use_logic_function/set_channel_cfg_of_pulseview.png) ### Debugging Waveforms #### View Operations Through view operations, you can observe waveforms in more detail. ![tag_of_pulseview](./../../../zh/logic_analyzer/combo8/assets/use_logic_function/tag_of_pulseview.png) **Waveform Zoom**: Use the mouse scroll wheel (middle button) to zoom in and out of the waveform. **Drag Waveform**: Hold down the left mouse button to drag the waveform display area horizontally and vertically. **Region Zoom**: Double click on a specific region to zoom in on that area of the waveform. **Channel Scroll**: In the waveform display area, use Ctrl + mouse scroll wheel (middle button) to quickly scroll the channels up and down. **Time Measurement**: You can create marker points by right clicking the desired position and selecting \"Create Marker Here.\" The software will automatically calculate and display the time length between two marker points on the time axis. **Adjust Channel Order**: Drag and drop a channel's label to rearrange the order of channels as needed. #### Protocol Decoding After capturing the required data, protocol decoding can be used to analyze the data more effectively. Below are the decoding processes for some common protocols. ##### UART Protocol Data Decoding 1. Connect the TX pin of the UART to the D0 channel. 2. Click on the **Yellow and Blue waveform icon** in the top toolbar, search for \"UART,\" and double click to select the UART option. ![uart_select](./../../../zh/logic_analyzer/combo8/assets/use_logic_function/logic_uart_select.png) 3.

Set the TX corresponding channel, data format, signal baud rate, and byte order. ![uart_set](./../../../zh/logic_analyzer/combo8/assets/use_logic_function/logic_uart_set.png) 4. Capture the data and the decoded result will be displayed: Example: UART's TX pin sends data \"Hello SLogic!\" (ASCII data format, baud rate 115200, little endian byte order) ![uart_tx](./../../../zh/logic_analyzer/combo8/assets/use_logic_function/logic_uart_tx.jpg) ##### I2C Protocol Data Decoding 1. Connect the SCL pin of the I2C to the D0 channel and the SDA pin to the D1 channel. 2. Click on the **Yellow and Blue waveform icon** in the top toolbar, search for \"I2C,\" and double click to select the first option. ![i2c_select](./../../../zh/logic_analyzer/combo8/assets/use_logic_function/logic_i2c_select.png) 3. Click on the **protocol label** of the newly added I2C channel in the waveform display window. Click on the added I2C **protocol label** and set the SCL and SDA channels. ![i2c_set](./../../../zh/logic_analyzer/combo8/assets/use_logic_function/logic_i2c_set.png) 4. Capture the data and the decoded result will be displayed: Example: I2C sends 0x68 ![i2c_value](./../../../zh/logic_analyzer/combo8/assets/use_logic_function/logic_i2c_0x68_write.jpg) ##### SPI Protocol Data Decoding 1. Connect the MISO, MOSI, CLK, and CS pins of the SPI to the D0, D1, D2, and D3 channels respectively. 2. Click on the **Yellow and Blue waveform icon** in the top toolbar, search for \"SPI,\" and double click to select the SPI option. ![spi_select](./../../../zh/logic_analyzer/combo8/assets/use_logic_function/logic_spi_select.png) 3.

Set the CLK, MISO, MOSI, and CS corresponding channels, and specify the active level of the chip select signal. ![spi_set](./../../../zh/logic_analyzer/combo8/assets/use_logic_function/logic_spi_set.png) 4. Capture the data and the decoded result will be displayed: Example: SPI sends 0x00~0x09 (clock 10MHz, low active chip select) ![spi_10mhz](./../../../zh/logic_analyzer/combo8/assets/use_logic_function/logic_spi_10mhz.jpg) Example: SPI sends 0x00~0x09 (clock 26MHz, low active chip select) ![spi_26mhz](./../../../zh/logic_analyzer/combo8/assets/use_logic_function/logic_spi_26mhz.jpg) ### Precautions When connecting the logic analyzer to the system under test, please note the following precautions: 1. The logic analyzer shares a common ground with the computer. If the system under test is a high voltage system, be sure to use a \"USB isolator\" for isolation. Otherwise, there is a risk of damaging the logic analyzer or computer. 2. The GND channel must be reliably connected to the ground of the system under test and kept as short as possible. 3. The signal channels must be securely connected to the test points of the system under test. Avoid haphazard \"tapping\" that could introduce interference. 4. Improper wiring may introduce glitches that could prevent proper data analysis in the software."},"/hardware/en/logic_analyzer/combo8/use_fouruart_function.html":{"title":"Using as Serial Module","content":" title: Using as Serial Module keywords: LogicAnalyzer, debugger, link, RISCV, tool update: date: 2023 07 26 version: v0.1 author: ctx content: Release docs SLogic Combo 8 has 4 independent high speed serial port functionalities. The first two ports based on UART can achieve a super high speed baud rate of up to 20Mbps simultaneously, while the latter two ports can reach up to 1Mbps through IO simulation. It is highly suitable for scenarios such as batch programming and production testing. ## Enable Serial Module Functionality Press the toggle button to switch the indicator light to red. ![slogic_led_red](./../../../zh/logic_analyzer/combo8/assets/use_fouruart_function/slogic_led_red.png) > To verify if Serial Module functionality is enabled: > Open the device manager in Windows environment, and use the lsusb command in Linux environment to find the \"UARTx4 HS\" device ## Getting Started ### Pin sequence ![fouruart_line_order](./../../../zh/logic_analyzer/combo8/assets/use_fouruart_function/fouruart_line_order.png) SLogic Combo 8 has a total of 4 serial ports. UART0 and UART1 support a maximum baud rate of 20M, while UART3 and UART4 support a maximum baud rate of 1M. Note： 1. Ensure that the module and the target device share a common ground to prevent issues such as garbled data. 2. The device numbers on Windows may be in random order, so manual trial and error may be required to find the corresponding serial port. ### Linux Please note: Due to system reasons, Linux may consider the device as a modem when it has more than one ttyACM. This may temporarily occupy the device for sending AT commands. In this situation, you may not be able to open the serial port, and it may report \"Resource busy\" due to device being occupied. This is normal, and it will return to normal after a while. To solve this problem, you can add a udev rule to avoid this issue. Please refer to the following commands: ```shell sudo touch /etc/udev/rules.d/49 sipeed.rules sudo echo \"ATTRS{idVendor} \\\"359f\\\", ATTRS{idProduct} \\\"3101\\\", ENV{ID_MM_DEVICE_IGNORE} \\\"1\\\"\" > /etc/udev/rules.d/49 sipeed.rules sudo udevadm control reload ``` ### Data Transmission and Reception For Linux, you can use **picocom** or **minicom** as the serial communication tool. Install it using the following commands: ```Bash sudo apt install picocom sudo apt install minicom ``` For example, to use **minicom** with UART0 to communicate with the test device, open the Linux terminal using **CTRL+ALT+T**, enter the installation commands, and enter the administrator user password when prompted. Wait for the package installation to complete. ![minicom_install_uart](./../../../zh/logic_analyzer/combo8/assets/use_fouruart_function/minicom_install_uart.png) After installation, communicate with the test device using UART0. In the terminal, enter the command: ```Bash sudo minicom b 2000000 D /dev/ttyACM0 ``` The ** b** parameter specifies the desired baud rate, which should be the same as the UART baud rate setting of the test device. The ** D** parameter specifies the port to listen to. ![minicom_uart](./../../../zh/logic_analyzer/combo8/assets/use_fouruart_function/minicom_uart.png) After entering the command, you can communicate with the test device, receive and print messages in the terminal, and send data to the test device. #### Serial Loopback Test： ![uart_line_uart](./../../../zh/logic_analyzer/combo8/assets/use_fouruart_function/uart_line_uart.jpg) (Above: Serial module wiring diagram) Loopback test result: ![minicom_test_uart](./../../../zh/logic_analyzer/combo8/assets/use_fouruart_function/minicom_test_uart.png) ### Windows In the Windows operating system, you can use tools like SSCOM, MobaXterm, and others as serial port communication tools. Here, we'll use **SSCOM** as an example to demonstrate how to perform serial communication tests. 1. First, download SSCOM. This software is open source, so please search and download it via an online search. 2. After the download is complete, extract and launch the serial port tool. You will see the following interface: ![SSCOM Interface](./../../../zh/logic_analyzer/combo8/assets/use_fouruart_function/sscom_gui.png) 3. Connect the module to your PC. Then, in the Windows Device Manager (shortcut `Win + X + M`), check if the connection was successful and obtain the port number information. ![Device Manager](./../../../zh/logic_analyzer/combo8/assets/use_fouruart_function/sscom_device_manage.png) Due to the nature of Windows systems, the port numbers might be in a disordered sequence. Therefore, you can follow these steps to test the corresponding port numbers: Connect the TX* and RX* pins of the module (* can be 0 3). Set the baud rate, typically using 115200. Open the serial port. Sequentially try different port device numbers, click the \"Send\" button, and check if data is received to confirm the corresponding serial port for each. ![Confirm Port](./../../../zh/logic_analyzer/combo8/assets/use_fouruart_function/sscom_determine_port.png) 4. After confirming the port numbers for each serial port, you can input the data you want to send in the data input window. Simultaneously, received data will also be displayed in the window. #### Transmission and Reception Testing Using the SLogic 4xUART module for serial communication testing, the first two virtual serial ports can achieve a maximum speed of 20Mbps. Here's an example of testing performance using SSCOM. ##### 1Mbps Test (256kbps, 512kbps) 1. Connect TX2 and RX3. 2. Start two instances of SSCOM, connecting them to the respective serial ports. 3. Set the baud rate to 1000000 and open the serial port. 4. Create a 256KB text file with repetitive common characters. 5. Use SSCOM's file sending feature, select the newly created text file and send it. 6. The other instance of SSCOM will receive the data and verify the received file content. Below is the result of the 1Mbps test (256KB). Confirm the success of the test by checking the file size and data content. ![1Mbps Test (256KB)](./../../../zh/logic_analyzer/combo8/assets/use_fouruart_function/uart_sscom_1mbps_256kb.png) Increase the data size of the text file to 512KB and repeat the test to confirm the success of sending and receiving 512KB of data at 1Mbps. ![1Mbps Test (512KB)](./../../../zh/logic_analyzer/combo8/assets/use_fouruart_function/uart_sscom_1mbps_512kb.png) ##### 20Mbps Test (256kbps) 1. Connect TX0 and RX1. 2. Start two instances of SSCOM, connecting them to the respective serial ports. 3. Set the baud rate to 20000000 and open the serial port. 4. Create a 256KB text file with repetitive common characters. 5. Use SSCOM's file sending feature, select the newly created text file and send it. 6. The other instance of SSCOM will receive the data and verify the received file content. Below is a screenshot of the test results.

If the problem persists, click [here](./update_firmware.html) to update the firmware and try again. **Q:**The LED doesn't change after pressing the button? **A:**Check that the interval between key presses is not less than 100ms, otherwise it may cause the module to enter boot mode and you will see that LED no longer change. If this occurs, re power up the module to restore it ## Logic Analyzer **Q:** After clicking \"run\", the prompt \"device closed but should be open.\" ![image 20230816113213933](./../../../zh/logic_analyzer/combo8/assets/use_logic_function/tips_capture_failed.png) **A:**This may be the result of unstable contact that causes the device to disconnect, try to re plug the device and then reconnect it to solve the problem. **Q:**When using 8 channel sampling, it was found that waveforms also appeared when the D7 channel was not connected. **A:**This is a problem to be solved, but this problem will not affect the sampled waveforms, and the waveform can still be acquired normally after connecting an external signal to the D7 channel. **Q:**When sampling waveforms, the waveforms in the display window do not match the actual waveforms. **A:**Make sure that you connect the GND wire of the logic analyser to the GND of the target device, and make sure that the GND wire is as close as possible to the location of the point to be measured. Be aware that even at a distance of 1cm, there may be many components in between that can interfere with the signal, so even 1cm closer is likely to give better signal quality. **Q:**Logic analyser can't sample for long periods of time **A:**There are multiple situations: **Situation 1:** Sampling time is very small due to incorrect setting of sampling points and sampling rate, sampling time (unit:s) sampling points/sampling rate, please make sure that the sampling points and sampling rate are set correctly. **Situation 2:** Effect from PC performance. As PulseView needs to use a lot of USB bandwidth, but if the PC performance is poor at this time, it will also result in shorter sampling times. **Situation 3:** If everything is fine, check if the number of sampling points is set too large, resulting in a memory overflow that prevents sampling ## DAPLink **Q:**MDK can't find DAPLink device **A:**It is possible that the MDK version is too low, and a low version of MDK may not be able to recognise DAPLink (the MDK version used for testing in this article is V5.38). If the MDK version is too low to recognise DAPLink, if you don't want to upgrade the version, you can refer to the method [here](https://developer.arm.com/documentation/ka003663/latest/) to update the debug driver of CMSIS DAP. **Q:**The serial port function in DAPLink mode does not work properly and messages are echoed back **A:**Please refer [here](./update_firmware.html) to update the firmware to the latest version before trying again **Q:**DAPLink error while burning firmware:`Connection refused due to device mismatch!` ![image 20230816113213933](./assets/err_device_mismatch.jpg) **A:**It may be caused by the mismatch between the chip package and the actual chip.

Steps: Use type C cable connect computer with the board marked TTYS0, then do following steps depending on your computer OS. ### Linux & macOS For linux OS, use command `ls /dev/ttyUSB*` to see your device COM number, then use serial application to connect the board. ### Windows Lichee MaixSense equips with CH340 as serial chip, but we need install its driver to use it. Click this to download the driver for this serial chip, after installing [ch340 ch341 driver](https://api.dl.sipeed.com/shareURL/MAIX/tools/ch340_ch341_driver), you can find your `device serial port` from `Device manager`. ## Config Tina OS We suggest beginners use Armbian OS because there is a lot of information about it on the internet, and for Tina OS suits those who are good at Linux. The Tina OS configuration steps of Lichee MaixSense are similar to [M2dock](./../M2/usage.html), so here will not retell its usages. <! You can use type c cable connecting computer with Lichee MaixSense type c port marked with DEBUG, then use serial software application like [Mobaxterm](./../M2/tools/mobaxterm.html) to operate it. Besides, Lichee MaixSense with Tina OS can be operated by [adb shell](https://developer.android.google.cn/studio/releases/platform tools), if it's connected with computer by its type c port, which connects a USB camera by default, marked with OTG. > ## Config armbian OS After connecting computer with this board, we can use serial application to control this board, and the baudrate is 115200. We provide 2 armbian image, their login steps are different, so here we tell how to login ths OS. ### Image containing MaixPy3 The username and password are all `root`. Be sure not input any wrong word when logging. The log is as following if you succeed logging.\\ ```bash Armbian 21.08.0 trunk Bullseye ttyS0 maixsense login: root Password: __ __ _ ____ \\/ __ _(_)_ __/ ___ ___ _ __ ___ ___ \\/ / _` \\ \\/ /\\___ \\ / _ \\ '_ \\/ __/ _ \\ (_ > < ___) __/ \\__ \\ __/ _ _\\__,__/_/\\_\\____/ \\____ ____/\\___ Welcome to Armbian 21.08.0 trunk Bullseye with bleeding edge Linux 5.14.0 rc7 sun50iw11 No end user support: built from trunk & unsupported (bullseye) userspace!

If you didn't set the password at the first time, there is no way to login anymore, only reburn system you can get the chance to set the password again. If the password you set at the first time is complex enough, the system wil not accept the password and you need reset your password. ```bash New to Armbian? Documentation: https://docs.armbian.com Support: https://forum.armbian.com New root password: ********** Repeat password: ********** ``` After setting the password, we need to choose our shell, normally we use bash. ```bash Choose default system command shell: 1) bash 2) zsh Shell: BASH ``` Then it asked to add a new user to avoid us only using root username, which is a good way to help us not destroying the system. Set the username and password by yourself. ```bash Creating a new user account. Press <Ctrl C> to abort Please provide a username (eg. your forename): ll Create password: ********* Repeat password: ********* ``` The new created user is granted root permission by default, and we can use this identity to login this board and control this system. We can use command `passwd` to change the password or delete the password. For example, we can use `passwd d root` to delete the root password which we create at the beginning. We also can use `passwd root` to reset password of root. The following log are examples about `passwd` ```bash root@maixsense:~# passwd d root passwd: password expiry information changed. root@maixsense:~# passwd root New password: Retype new password: passwd: password updated successfully ``` Here are part of example: ![](./../assets/../M2A/assets/2021080511 46 52.gif)"},"/hardware/en/maixII/M2A/maixsense.html":{"title":"MaixSense","content":"# MaixSense This board is different from Maix I series, it's main chip not only incorporates AI acceleration hardcore, but also supports running armbian operating systems. ## M2A core board M2A core board use R329 as main chip, and also contains components like power management chip, fel burn key, wifi module, storage pad reserved and RMGII interface. ![M2A](./../../maixII/M2A/assets/M2A.jpg) ### R329 chip R329 is a 64 bits processor designed by Allwinner containing dual Cortex A53 inside, with 2 HIFI4 DSP used for audio pre processing and post processing, containing an extremely low energy consumption AIPU (Artificial intelligence processing unit) whose hash rate over 0.256 TOPS designed by ARM China, can be used to accelerate neural network, dealing with the 720P image captured by camera. ![R329_function_block](./../assets/../M2A/assets/R329_1.png) Item Specs CPU Dual core ARM Cortex™ A53@1.5GHz<br>32KB L1 I cache + 32KB L1 D cache per core<br>256KB L2 cache DSP Dual core HiFi4@400MHz<br> 32KB L1 I cache + 32KB L1 D cache per core<br> 2MB SRAM NPU zhouyi™Z1 AIPU，0.25TOPS@600MHz RAM 256MB DDR3 inside Storge Support SPI Nand/Nor/eMMC Audio Supports 5 audio ADC and 2 audio DAC<br>Supports 5 analog audio inputs and 2 analog audio output<br>Up to 3 I2S/PCM controllers for Bluetooth and external audio codec<br>Integrated digital microphone, supports up to 8 digital microphones Enthernet 10/100/1000 Mbps USB OTG \\* 1<br>Host \\* 1 SDIO SDIO 3.0 * 2 I2S I2S*3(I2S0, I2S1, S I2S0) SPI SPI*2(SPI0, SPI1) TWI TWI*3(TWI0, TWI1, S TWI0) GPADC 4 ch SCR SCR*1 PWM PWM*15(PWM[8:0], S PWM[5:0]) ### MaixSense MaixSense is a really small Linux card computer.

After finishing this work it will be back to the console for us to control it. ## Connect network Here we use `nmtui` to connect network. ![](./../../zh/../maixII/M2A/assets/202108051626.gif) <details> <summary><font color \"#4F84FF\">Click to see graphic steps</font></summary> <p>Enter nmtui to open NetworkManager TUI</p> <img src \"./../../../zh/maixII/M2A/assets/wifi/nmtui.png\" alt \"nmtui\"> <img src \"./../../../zh/maixII/M2A/assets/wifi/active_wifi.png\" alt \"active_wifi\"> <p>We choose Activate a connection</p> <p>Choose your target wifi </p> <img src \"./../../../zh/maixII/M2A/assets/wifi/choose_wifi.png\" alt \"choose_wifi\"> <img src \"./../../../zh/maixII/M2A/assets/wifi/input_password_1.png\" alt \"input_password_1\"> <p>Input the correct password</p> <img src \"./../../../zh/maixII/M2A/assets/wifi/input_password_2.png\" alt \"input_password_2\"> <p>It will display connecting</p> <img src \"./../../../zh/maixII/M2A/assets/wifi/connect_wifi.png\" alt \"connect_wifi\"> <p>The active on the right change into Deactive if succeed connecting wifi</p> <p>If failed connecting wifi, please retry and input the correct password</p> <img src \"./../../../zh/maixII/M2A/assets/wifi/succeed_connecting.png\" alt \"succeed_connecting\"> <p>Then we back to the command console</p> <img src \"./../../../zh/maixII/M2A/assets/wifi/quit_connecting.png\" alt \"quit_connecting\"> <img src \"./../../../zh/maixII/M2A/assets/wifi/quit_nmtui.png\" alt \"quit_nmtui\"> <img src \"./../../../zh/maixII/M2A/assets/wifi/back_terminal.png\" alt \"back_terminal\"> <p>Use command ifconfig to get the IP of this board</p> <img src \"./../../../zh/maixII/M2A/assets/wifi/ifconfig.png\" alt \"ifconfig\"> <img src \"./../../../zh/maixII/M2A/assets/wifi/see_ip.png\" alt \"see_ip\"> <p>If we see the IP(marked with red box), we have succeed connecting the network</p> </details> ## Add user Normally we use another user to use linux system instead of root user, because root user can break the system the easily. Here we tell how to create a new user by `adduser` command. Add a user named `xxx` ```bash adduser xxx ``` After some log shows up, we need to set the password. ```bash New password: Retype new password: ``` The following log shows up if we succeed setting password. ```bash passwd: password updated successfully ``` Then we press `Enter` for all following settings by default. ```bash Enter the new value, or press ENTER for the default Full Name []: Room Number []: Work Phone []: Home Phone []: Other []: Is the information correct? [Y/n] ``` Then we succeed creating the user named `xxx`. We can use command `login` to use our new created user: ```bash login xxx ``` Use command `logout` to sign out. ```bash logout ``` ### Grant administrator privilege The new created user may need administrator privilege to do finish some work, so here we tell how to grant administrator privilege. To grant administrator privilege, we just need to edit a file named `sudoers` in `/etc`. ```bash sudo nano /etc/sudoers ``` Find following content in this file. ```vim # User privilege specification root ALL (ALL:ALL) ALL ``` Add `xxx ALL (ALL:ALL) ALL` in that file (`xxx` is the username to be grant administrator privilege) ```vim # User privilege specification root ALL (ALL:ALL) ALL xxx ALL (ALL:ALL) ALL ``` Then save this file and quit editing. ## Install application Here we take install `armbian config` as example, just run following command: ```bash sudo apt install armbian config y ``` The above command means to install armbian config by running the apt application with root privileges and that everything which needs to be selected is the yes option ## Config Timezone Just use `armbian config` to change timezone. Here we take change to Shanghai time as example. `armbian config` > `Presonal` > `Timezone` > `Asia` > `Shanghai` to set Shanghai time as timezone, then use keyboard `Tab` switch to OK to finish our settings. ![202108062005](./../../../zh/maixII/M2A/assets/202108062005.gif) ## Config language We also use `armbian config` to change language. Just `armbian config` > `Personal` > `Locales`, and select your target language, then choose the default system language. Dont't forget to download your language font to avoid wrong display. ## Use Bluetooth Use `armbian config`. `armbian config` > `Network` > `BTinstall` to install bluetooth support package. ![](./../../../zh/maixII/M2A/assets/202108071034.gif) Then we can use `bluetoothctl` to use the bluetooth. ```bash root@maixsense:~# bluetoothctl Agent registered [CHG] Controller XX:XX:XX:XX:XX:XX Pairable: yes [bluetooth]# help Menu main: Available commands: advertise Advertise Options Submenu scan Scan Options Submenu gatt Generic Attribute Submenu list List available controllers show [ctrl] Controller information select <ctrl> Select default controller devices List available devices paired devices List paired devices system alias <name> Set controller alias reset alias Reset controller alias power <on/off> Set controller power pairable <on/off> Set controller pairable mode discoverable <on/off> Set controller discoverable mode discoverable timeout [value] Set discoverable timeout agent <on/off/capability> Enable/disable agent with given capability default agent Set agent as the default one advertise <on/off/type> Enable/disable advertising with given type set alias <alias> Set device alias scan <on/off> Scan for devices info [dev] Device information pair [dev] Pair with device cancel pairing [dev] Cancel pairing with device trust [dev] Trust device untrust [dev] Untrust device block [dev] Block device unblock [dev] Unblock device remove <dev> Remove device connect <dev> Connect device disconnect [dev] Disconnect device menu <name> Select submenu version Display version quit Quit program exit Quit program help Display help about this program export Print environment variables ``` ### Connect to Bluetooth device Use `bluetoothctl` to connect to bluetooth device. ```bash scan on scan off trust XX:XX:XX:XX pair XX:XX:XX:XX connect XX:XX:XX:XX ``` ![202108071610](./../../../zh/maixII/M2A/assets/202108071610.gif) ### Set bluetooth audio in/out To start this, we need install `pulseaudio` and bluetooth modules ```bash sudo apt install pulseaudio sudo apt install pulseaudio module bluetooth ``` Then use pactl command to see whether there is device for bluetooth audio output. ```bash pactl list short sinks ``` Switch audio output to bluetooth, the `<dev>` in the following command should be `2`. ```bash pactl set default sink <dev> ``` The log is as following： ```bash maixsense:~:# apt install pulseaudio maixsense:~:# apt install pulseaudio module bluetooth maixsense:~:# pactl list short sinks 0\talsa_output.platform 7032000.codec.stereo fallback\tmodule alsa card.c\ts16le 2ch 44100Hz\tSUSPENDED 2\tbluez_sink.00_26_04_00_73_B1.a2dp_sink\tmodule bluez5 device.c\ts16le 2ch 44100Hz\tSUSPENDED maixsense:~:# pactl set default sink 2 ``` ![202108071726](./../../../zh/maixII/M2A/assets/202108071726.gif) Then we can play audio to a Bluetooth device or connect the phone via Bluetooth to use as a Bluetooth speaker. ## Change volume Here we use `alsamixer` to change volume ![202108071440](./../../../zh/maixII/M2A/assets/202108071440.gif) Use keyboard `H` to see help. ![alsamixer](./assets/alsamixer.png) To change Bluetooth volume, we use `pactl`. Besides, we can also use `pactl` to change the volume of onboard speaker. ```bash ## See the input/output device index pactl list short sources/sinks ## Sets the input/output volume pactl set source/sink volume index volume pactl set default source/sink ## Set the default input/output ``` For example, set the Bluetooth headset as the output device, the volume is 10%, then increased by 20%, and finally reduced by 30% ```bash maixsense:~:# pactl list short sinks 0\talsa_output.platform 7032000.codec.stereo fallback\tmodule alsa card.c\ts16le 2ch 44100Hz\tSUSPENDED 2\tbluez_sink.00_26_04_00_73_B1.a2dp_sink\tmodule bluez5 device.c\ts16le 2ch 44100Hz\tRUNNING ## The bluetooth normally is bluez_sink maixsense:~:# pactl set default sink 2 maixsense:~:# pactl set sink volume 2 10% maixsense:~:# pactl set sink volume 2 +8192 maixsense:~:# pactl set sink volume 2 0x3000 ##Optional number, Percentage, Decimal, Hexadecimal control, same resule, and can exceed 100% ``` ## Media player Normally we use `mplayer` for media play. Install mplayer ```bash sudo apt install mplayer y ``` Then transfer the media file to the board. The media file can be downloaded from our [Download station](https://dl.sipeed.com/shareURL/MaixII/MaixII Dock/example) We can use [mobaxterm](https://mobaxterm.mobatek.net/) connect the board by SSH protocol, then use [mobaxterm](https://mobaxterm.mobatek.net/) to transfer the media file to the board. Drag your media file to the red box in the left of the following picture. ![mobaxterm_ssh_transfer](./assets/mobaxterm_ssh_transfer.png) Use command `sudo mplayer badapple_240_60fps.mp4 vo fbdev2` to play video or `sudo mplayer Short.mp3` to play audio. ```bash mplayer badapple_240_60fps.mp4 vo fbdev2 ``` Use onboard `Ctrl+C` to exit the media playing. We can also add `< /dev/null > /dev/null 2>1 &` in the end of the command to play the media background. ```bash mplayer badapple_240_60fps.mp4 vo fbdev2 < /dev/null > /dev/null 2>1 & ``` The command above plays media background, if you wang to stop it, you need to use `fg` command to switch the background application to the front, then use `Ctrl+C` to stop it. ![202108091128](./../../../zh/maixII/M2A/assets/202108091128.gif) If it didn't play media correctly, try to increase the media volume by `alsamixer` application or check the media file path whether matchs the command. ## Program C code Here we use `vim` as the editor. You can learn many skills about from Internet. Use command `sudo apt install vim y` to install `vim`. Then create a file named `helloworld.c` by vim. ```bash vim helloworld.c ``` There are 3 modes in vim: `Command mode`, `Insert mode` and `Last line mode`. The default mode after creating a new file is `Command mode`, we press the 'i' on the keyboard to enter `Insert mode`. Then we input the following codes as the content in the new created file. ```c #include <stdio.h> int main() { printf(\"Hello, world\\n\"); return 0; } ``` We use keyboard `esc` to quit `Insert mode` to `Command mode`. Then use `:` to `Last line mode`, use command `wq` wo save and quit editing. Then we use gcc to compile our code. If there ie no gcc, install it by apt. The detailed usage about gcc can be searched from Internet. ```bash gcc hello.c o hello.o ``` After finishing compiling our code, run it. ```bash ./hello.o ``` ![202108091201](./../../../zh/maixII/M2A/assets/202108091201.gif) ## Prepare python code See [Program C code](#program c code) to get explanation. ```bash vim helloworld.py i print(\"hello world!\\n\") esc :wq python3 helloworld.py ``` ![202108091339](./../../../zh/maixII/M2A/assets/202108091339.gif) ## Light an led by python Install the python GPIO library first. ```bash pip install gpiod ``` Then insert the led positive electrode into PH5, and negative electrode into GND.

Then we just need to add what we want to run at startup to the rc.local file to achieve startup start. Edit the auto start script. ```bash vim /etc/rc.local ``` Add the operations you want to do at startup before ``exit 0`. ```bash echo \"hello world!\" ``` Then restart the board. For example, after editing the auto start script, it executes before user logs in, and the execution example log is as follows. ```bash [ OK ] Finished Permit User Sessions. [ 38.569457] rc.local[1322]: hello world! ``` It's suggested not to use serial port ar startup, this will make us unable to use the board by serial port. ## More usage Visit [MaixPy3](/soft/maixpy3/zh/readme.md)(English docs will be updated soon)"},"/hardware/en/maixII/M2A/flash_system.html":{"title":"Burn image","content":"# Burn image ## System introduction There are 2 system images for Lichee MaixSense(which will be called R329 below) Image name armbian Tina : : : Description A lightweight Debian for arm development board Linux system created by Allwinner Based on OpenWRT1404 Feature Linux mainline, mutiple contents Tiny os Target users Geeker, or newer Customization requirements developer For armbian system image it's required to use sdcard over than 4GBi For Tina os it needs sdcard over than 512MBi Low speed sdcard will lead a bad experience ## Get image ### armbian system image Download armbian system image from MEGA ：https://mega.nz/folder/1B4RFKpK#X0tMwHLHFQJvJ9POt_lXtg The image named with maixpy3 means this image has installed MaixPy3 and its related drivers This image file is created by [dd](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dd_(Unix)).

The OpenWrt is a Linux operating system targeting embedded devices. Visit [official website](https://openwrt.org) and [official open repository](https://github.com/openwrt/openwrt) for more details. For V831 we use adb shell to control it. Connect otg interface marked on board with computer. Fow Windows users, download the latest adb, add its path into system path and save it then use command `adb shell` to connect V831. For linux we need to install adb first, then run command `adb shell` to connect V831. ## Wireless connection There is a 2.4G wireless module on M2Dock, with which we can connect to wireless network. Because of the change of different system image, the ways to connect to wireless network on V0.5.4 system version and system version before V0.5.4 are different. ### V0.5.4 In this system version, we remove the way to connect wireless network by editing `wpa_supplicant.conf` file of the u disk, and we use commands to connect wireless network. We can see there are many linux commands about wifi in this system. ![wifi_test_command_list](./../../../zh/maixII/M2/asserts/usage/wifi_test_command_list.jpg) Here we use `wifi_connect_ap_test` to connect wireless network, and we can use `wifi_scan_results_test` to scan the wireless network to see whether M2Dock detects your target network. We use following command connect wireless network named `Sipeed_Guest` and its password is `qwert123`. ```bash wifi_connect_ap_test Sipeed_Guest qwert123 ``` Change `Sipeed_Guest` into your target wireless network name and change `qwert123` into your target wireless network password. ![wifi_test_connect_wireless](./../../../zh/maixII/M2/asserts/usage/wifi_test_connect_wireless.jpg) From the connection message, we can see `192.168.3.158`, this is the IP address of M2Dock in this network environment. We can run `ifconfig` on M2Dock to see the ip address, from which we see that the ip address is the same as the wireless network connection message. ![wifi_test_ifconfig](./../../../zh/maixII/M2/asserts/usage/wifi_test_ifconfig.jpg) ### V0.5.4 and previous image Connect M2Dock USB OTG port to computer, there is a u disk in your computer. Edit the `wpa_supplicant.conf` file which is in the u disk, ![wap_conf_png](./../../../zh/maixII/M2/asserts/usage/wap_conf.png) Change `yourWIFIname` and `yourWIFIpassword` into your target wireless network name and password. Then remove the u disk from your system, use your operating system command to remove the u disk, otherwise this file will be damaged. After removing the u disk, reboot M2Dock by press RST KEY. ![wap_conf_gif](./../../../zh/maixII/M2/asserts/usage/wap_conf.gif) ### Update MaixPy3 Download MaixPy3 manually: https://pypi.org/project/maixpy3/#history ![maixpy3_download](./../../../zh/maixII/M2/asserts/usage/maixpy3_download.png) Download the file whose name incorporates `cp38`, then rename it into `maixpy3 9.9.9 cp38 cp38 linux_armv7l.whl`, save it into the u disk of M2Dock, reboot your board and maixpy3 will update automatically at boot up. ![maixpy3_install](./../../../zh/maixII/M2/asserts/usage/maixpy3_install.png) Do Not Do Any Operation When Updating. ### Okpg package management The opkg utility is the lightweight package manager used for upgrading the functionality of the system rather significantly by downloading and installing pre made packages from package repositories. #### Related common commands opkg update # Update the updatable utility opkg upgrade # Upgrade the upgradable utility opkg list # list all utility opkg install # install target utility opkg remove # remove target utility For example： ```bash root@sipeed:/# opkg list MaixPy3 0.2.5 1 alsa lib 1.1.4.1 1 busybox 1.27.2 3 busybox init base files 167 1612350358 ca certificates 20160104 curl 7.54.1 1 dropbear 2015.71 2 e2fsprogs 1.42.12 1 eyesee mpp external 1.0 1 eyesee mpp middleware 1.0 1 eyesee mpp system 1.0 1 ``` ## Test screen There is a flushing on screen after power on. this means the board is well working, and the flushing is caused by the system reset.

One masked UART is for the serial communication between this board and computer, another port masked with OTG is used for user defined functions. We set it `usb_device` default, so we can use `adb` to control this board by default. And by `adb forware`, we can run jupyter code on M2Dock without network but only one usb cable. To connect USB camera, we need to set the OTG port to be the usb_host. Run the following command on M2Dock to change its function, but remember this command will stop the communication between computer and M2Dock via ADB USB OTG port. ```bash echo \"usb_host\" > /sys/devices/platform/soc/usbc0/otg_role ``` Then we can control the USB camera device which is in the /dev directory. ## How to set USB OTG port usb_device mode The OTG port is usb device mode by default, by which we can control this board via `adb`. And maybe we changed its function to be a USB host for some reason and now we want to change it back to being a USB device. Just run the following command on M2Dock(You can run the following command on M2Dock via UART with 115200 baudrate). ```bash echo \"usb_device\" > /sys/devices/platform/soc/usbc0/otg_role ``` ## ToolChain [Here](https://dl.sipeed.com/shareURL/MaixII/MaixII Dock/SDK/Toolchain) is a toolchain for V831, it can be run in linux system. ## MaixPy3 We suggest you use [Maixpy3](/maixpy3) to develop , and its English documents will come out soon. ## SDK development Now we have open V831 source code here, use this https://github.com/Tina Linux/tina V83x if you need."},"/hardware/en/maixII/M2/tools/mobaxterm.html":{"title":"如何使用 mobaxterm","content":" title: 如何使用 mobaxterm keywords: Jupyter, MaixPy3, Python, Python3 desc: maixpy 如何使用 mobaxterm ## mobaxterm 是什么？ 这是在 Windows 下使用的全能终端管理软件，对开发与运维人员必备，可以在 [mobaxterm.mobatek.net/download](https://mobaxterm.mobatek.net/download.html) 获取免费版本使用，在国内网站上有中文版。 ![](https://mobaxterm.mobatek.net/img/moba/features/feature terminal.png) 主要通过它提供的下列功能： serial 通过串口连接 Linux 系统的终端 ssh 远程登录 Linux 系统的终端 ftp 远程访问文件服务上的资源 ## 连接 Serial 开源硬件产品大多都会预留串口（Serial）用作 Linux 系统的终端交互接口，下面介绍串口【session】的创建。 ![](./asserts/mobaxterm serial 4.png) 在「session setting」 对话框里选择【serial】，再选好串口号及波特率，点击【OK】就完成连接了。 ![](./asserts/mobaxterm serial 5.png) 同样【session】会保存在左侧的【session】标签页里，方便下次连接。 ## 连接 SSH 除了有线串口的方式，还可以通过无线访问 SSH 登录 Linux 系统，如一般的家用路由器。 在 Linux 系统输入 ifconfig 查看自己 ip 地址（192.168.1.185），然后输入自己名称和密码，常见有 root / root 。 > 如果没有设置密码，root 的连接密码是 root 。输入密码的时候是看不到的，在输入结束之后，按回车即可 ![](./asserts/mobaxterm_ssh.jpg) 就可以看到 Linux 的登录会话终端了。 ![](./asserts/mobaxterm_ssh_view.jpg) > 以下连接方式只是合适在 MaixII Dock 上使用的，需要使用 MaixPy3 IDE 版本 0.4.2以上的版本 MaixII Dock 可以通过 OTG 接口转发到 127.0.0.1 的 22 端口，但是每次使用之前，都需要通过运行 IDE 来进行配置，进行 ssh 端口转发服务的开启。 具体的连接方式和上面的 ssh 方式一样，只需要将 ip 地址修改成 127.0.0.1 即可，默认用户名和密码都是 root。 ## 连接 FTP 与 SSH 同理。 ![](./asserts/mobaxterm_ftp.png) 进入后就可以看到文件夹了。 ![](./asserts/mobaxterm_ftp.jpg) 可以拖拽文件上传和下载。 ![](./asserts/mobaxterm_ftp_ud.png) ## 如何进行编程 除了使用串口进行 Python 代码的复制粘贴运行，还可以通过在 FTP 文件管理获取下图的代码编辑器，编辑后保存就会自动同步上传（下图为 C 代码参考，其他代码同理）。 ![](https://mobaxterm.mobatek.net/img/moba/features/feature mobatexteditor.png) 这时候再拿到终端里运行 Python 脚本即可。 ```bash python xxxx.py ```"},"/hardware/en/maixII/M2/tools/vscode.html":{"title":"如何使用 vscode","content":" title: 如何使用 vscode keywords: vscode, MaixPy3, Python, Python3 desc: maixpy 如何使用 vscode ## 前言 它是微软出品的一款可扩展的轻量级开源编辑器，并且支持全平台系统。这些特性使得 VSCode 颇受欢迎，这也使其成为了一个很棒的 Python 开发平台。 关于如何安装和使用它的教程已经数不胜数，这里只推荐[【用 VSCode 愉快地写 Python 代码】](https://zhuanlan.zhihu.com/p/66157046)。 ## 为什么要使用它？ 除了专业 Python 代码开发环境，它还支持打开 jupyter notebook 文档运行代码。 与浏览器运行的 jupyter notebook 一样，执行 Python 代码的时候要选择对应的执行核心，如 [ipython/ipykernel](https://github.com/ipython/ipykernel) 或者 [rpyc_ikernel](https://github.com/sipeed/rpyc_ikernel) 的核心。 下面就来说说如何使用它。 ### 创建 notebook 文档 ![](https://tukuimg.bdstatic.com/scrop/abb1e4146fb8679109fa99aa0b03f59f.gif) ### 运行 Python 代码 ![](https://tukuimg.bdstatic.com/scrop/a1e2381bfac1a332a323774ee1b49c9f.gif) ### 运行后预览图表 ![](https://tukuimg.bdstatic.com/scrop/9c5bf21507c776f98d55bcfc0e51c5ff.gif) ## 你可以学到什么？ 在 VS Code 中使用 Jupyter 笔记本时需要进行的基本操作。如果您使用 VS Code 来满足其他开发需求，那么在 VS Code 中尝试使用 Jupyter Notebook 是非常方便的，这样您就可以只使用一个 IDE。特别是其代码自动补齐的功能可以让你的开发更快捷。 > 需要注意的是，截止 2021年3月3日 在 VSCODE 里的 jupyter notebook 文档进行中断存在一些问题，并不是很流畅，如果出现了运行无响应的问题可以重新打开文档解决问题。"},"/hardware/en/maixII/M2/tools/adb.html":{"title":"adb 操作介绍","content":"# adb 操作介绍 ADB.exe 在 MaixPy3 IDE 中的 maixpy3_examples 和 PhoenixSuit 文件夹下 ## 链接开发板 将开发板上的 OTG 接口接上电脑， 然后再命令行中输入 adb shell，会自动进入到开发板的 linux 系统中 ```shell BusyBox v1.27.2 () built in shell (ash) run profile file __ ___ _ __ _ / / /__ _(_)_ __ / / (_)__ __ ____ __ / /_/ / _ `/ /\\ \\ / / /__/ / _ \\/ // /\\ \\ / /_/ /_/\\_,_/_//_\\_\\ /____/_/_//_/\\_,_//_\\_\\ root@sipeed:/# ``` 这时可以开始使用 MaixPy3 进行开发了"},"/hardware/en/maixII/M2/PhoenixSuit.html":{"title":"","content":""},"/hardware/en/maixII/M2/other.html":{"title":"Others","content":" title: Others keywords: MaixII, MaixPy3, Python, Python3, M2dock desc: maixpy Others > Edit on 2022.08.23 This essay tells additional usages about V831 development board.

On the latest ext board we marked `v3768`, and the pervious ext board is not marked. 2. We use `RTL8189FTV` Wifi module on the latest ext board, and the pervious ext board use Wifi module `RTL8723BS`, replace the kernel file to change the configuration. Read [No wlan0](#qno wlan0 shown in result after running command ifconfig) to know more. ```bash ls /boot/ cp kernel.img.rtl8723bs kernel.img # For the previous ext board #cp /boot/kernel.img.rtl8189fs kernel.img ``` ![qa_board_change](./assets/qa/qa_board_change.jpg) ### Change of camera The connector direction of camera changed, make sure the `1` on the connector of ext board matches the `1` the connector of the camera. ![qa_camera_change](./assets/qa/qa_camera_change.jpg) ### Change of screen We change the screen into new version, and the default image use the latest version screen, see following photo to know your screen version, and for pervious version screen if need to run command `cp /boot/dtb.img.lcd20220830 dtb.img` to apply the hardware. Read [wrong display](#qscreen display wrong) to know more. ![qa_screen_change](./assets/qa/qa_screen_change.jpg) ## Q：Why I can only use less than 2G ram Why we can only see there is about 1.3G ram for us. ![htop_memory_usage](./assets/qa/htop_memory_usage.png) From the following diagram we can see the original memory map of Axera 620A evb board, it's equipped with 1GB ram and is divided into 256MB kernel memory block and 768MB CMM (Contiguous Memory Model) memory block ![faq_ddr](./../../../zh/maixIII/assets/faq_ddr.png) And on Axera Pi we equip 2GB ram, and set 512M CMM memory block and 256M kernel memory block, so there is less than 2GB ram for use. We can see the `insmod /soc/ko/ax_cmm.ko cmmpool anonymous,0,0x60000000,512M` to initialize 512M MMC memory from the `auto_load_all_drv.sh`. ![cmm_memory_size_script](./assets/qa/cmm_memory_size_script.png) CCM memory block is used for NPU and ISP processing, processor will use this CMM memory for imaging processing and model processing task.

For embedded linux, we usually use cross compile technology to compile out the application for target linux device. A cross compiler is a compiler capable of creating executable code for a platform other than the one on which the compiler is running. For example, a cross compiler executes on machine X and produces machine code for machine Y. Normally our computer have better performance than target embedded linux device, compiling the executable on our computer, then run the application on target embedded linux device. This saves more time than compiling and running on target embedded linux device. For example, `ax sample` takes more than 10 minutes to be compiled on AXera Pi, but it takes less than one minute on your computer. Above all, for embedded development, coree compile technology is common and it's necessary to know about this if you want to save your time. ## Transfer files Compiling out the application on our computer, we need send the application to AXera Pi. `SSH` (Secure Shell) enables secure system administration and file transfers over insecure networks. `Serial` application tool is OK to transfer files but it's too slow. ### Transfer file with SSH There are many good SSH application on Windows, here we use [Mobaxterm](https://mobaxterm.mobatek.net/) to login AXera Pi and Transfer file. [Mobaxterm Usage Demo](https://mobaxterm.mobatek.net/demo.html) ![mobaxterm_transfer_file](./assets/dev_prepare/mobaxterm_transfer_file.jpg) Besides, [Vscode](https://code.visualstudio.com/) is also a good idea for transferring file. Install the [Remote SSH](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName ms vscode remote.remote ssh) and [Remote Explorer](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName ms vscode.remote explorer) extensions, then login to AXera Pi via vscode SSH. ![transfer_file_vscode](./assets/flash_system/transfer_file_vscode.jpg) ### Transfer file with scp scp means `ssh + cp`. Here is the command to transfer file. ```bash scp [option] /path/to/source/file user@server ip:/path/to/destination/directory ``` `/path/to/source/file` Target file/folder sent from host to device `user@server ip` : Remote target device IP address. `/path/to/destination/directory` Target device directory to receive the file/folder ### Use card reader Because of different file system, it's only suggested to use this way if operating system of your computer is Linux. ### Transfer file with UART For linux users, install `lrzsz` first (`sudo apt git install lrzsz`) and use it to finish this Windows user can use Mobaxterm to transfer file between computer and AXera Pi via USB UART connection. ## Compile on AXera Pi Here we tell how to compile application on AXera Pi. Because serial port connector is slow and can be only opened by only one application at one time, we usually login to AXera Pi by SSH, which we can open many terminals and enter different commands in different ssh terminal at the same time. ![ssh_mutiple_terminals](./assets/dev_prepare/ssh_mutiple_terminals.jpg) ### Vscode remote We have told how to login to AXera Pi via SSH with vscode, login to AXera Pi by Vscode first, make sure not install [C/C++](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName ms vscode.cpptools) extension of vscode on AXera Pi, this extension may close SSH connection. Click ① and ② to open a SSH connection. ![vscode_ssh_connect](./assets/dev_prepare/vscode_ssh_connect.jpg) Here we take `192.168.233.1` IP address as example, make sure not forget add username `root` at first. `root@IP_address` ![vscode_ssh_connect_example_ip](./assets/dev_prepare/vscode_ssh_connect_example_ip.jpg) Choose platform `Linux` and `Continue`. <img alt \"vscode_ssh_connect_linux_platform\" src \"./assets/dev_prepare/vscode_ssh_connect_linux_platform.jpg\" width \"45%\"> <img alt \"vscode_ssh_connect_continue\" src \"./assets/dev_prepare/vscode_ssh_connect_continue.jpg\" width \"45%\"> Eenter password `root` to login ![vscode_ssh_connect_enter_password](./assets/dev_prepare/vscode_ssh_connect_enter_password.jpg) Succeed logining to AXera Pi. ![vscode_ssh_connect_succeed_login](./assets/dev_prepare/vscode_ssh_connect_succeed_login.jpg) Click `Open Folder` to see your AXera Pi directory structure. ![transfer_file_vscode](./assets/flash_system/transfer_file_vscode.jpg) Use command <code>Ctrl + Shift + `</code> to new a terminal, run following command to compile <code>libmiax</code> application.

Compile libmaix example on AXera Pi: ![mobaxterm_compile_application](./assets/dev_prepare/mobaxterm_compile_application.jpg) ## Cross compiling on computer We compile out the application for AXera Pi on our computer first. AXera Pi is based on Cortex A7 arm architecture, while normally our computer is based on x86 64 architecture, these two different architectures are based on different instruction set. The binary executable program normally can not be executed on the same OS if the cpu architecture is not the same because different architecture means different instruction set. We can install the compiler for arm architecture on our computer, compiled by this compiler, we get the program which can execute on arm architecture device like AXera Pi. Here we compile the program based on ubuntu, then send the compiled program to AXera Pi and run on it. Install the compiler for AXera Pi first. ```bash sudo apt install gcc arm linux gnueabihf ``` Run following command to check your installation. ```bash arm linux gnueabihf gcc ``` The result should be as following. ![arm_linux_gxx_file_not_found](./assets/dev_prepare/arm_linux_gxx_file_not_found.jpg) New a C file named `cross_test.c`, and compile it by `arm linux gnueabihf gcc`. The content of the C file like this: ```c #include <stdio.h> int main(){ printf(\"Hello, AxPi!\\n\"); return 0; } ``` Then use following command to compile the C file. ```bash arm linux gnueabihf gcc o test cross_test.c static ``` Then we get the executable file named `test` on our computer, and if we run `./test`, it says `Exec format error`. Check file format of `test`, we can see it's `ELF 32 bit LSB executable, ARM, EABI5` ![test_program_example](./assets/dev_prepare/test_program_example.jpg) So it can only be executed on Axera Pi, sending the `test` executable file to AxPi, and on Axera Pi this program works well. ```bash csp test root@192.168.233.1:/home ``` By this command, we succeed upload the `test` executable file to Axera Pi via rndis protocol by `scp` command. And note that the password requirement of running command above is `root`. Then we can run `test` executable file on Axera Pi. ![hello_axpi](./assets/dev_prepare/hello_axpi.jpg) We finish cross compile. ## SDK Repositories Here are repositories for AXera Pi, check them if you need. ### libmaix [libmaix](https://github.com/sipeed/libmaix) is unified embedded development environment come by SIPEED, includes camera, screen, vision, image processing and pipelines related deployment examples, is suitable for those who want to learn embedded Linux. ### ax sample [ax sample](https://github.com/AXERA TECH/ax samples) includes typical AI models provided by Axera for development, evaluation and verification, those who are good at AI development or want to test these models can have a try, and these are not involved with peripherals. ### axpi_bsp_sdk [axpi_bsp_sdk](https://github.com/sipeed/axpi_bsp_sdk) is the bsp development package for business usage. It's the original development package for this chip, containing components like uboot, linux, msp, sample, rtsp, ipcdemo, and this is progressively open source, you can get these codes for commercial evaluation, such as ipcdemo, but normally these codes are complex and highly coupled, those who are experienced enough and want to use this board for business cooperation can try this. ### ax pipeline [ax pipeline](https://github.com/AXERA TECH/ax pipeline) is provided by Axera. With m3axpi, this project is used for people to know the usages of ISP, image processing, NPU, codec and display, which is convenient for developers to quickly evaluate and develop their own multimedia applications. ## SDK usage There are guides in each SDK Repositories. Here we tells how to build the program for AXera Pi with SDK Repositories. To begin this, we need install `git`, `cmake` first. ### libmaix #### Get SDK ```bash git clone https://github.com/sipeed/libmaix.git recursive ``` #### Compile SDK We have said that we can compile on AXera Pi or cross compile on our computer and send to AXera Pi. <! ### [libmaix](https://github.com/sipeed/libmaix) > /home/ 目录已预置，可以 git pull 联网拉取更新。 对于 `libmaix`， 按照其`README.md` 文件描述的方法编译即可， 不过需要在`menuconfig`命令中选择 `AXera Pi` 作为编译目标。 这里简要介绍一下编译过程（libmaix 目前还未稳定，未来可能会有大的更新），实际以[libmaix 仓库](https://github.com/sipeed/libmaix)代码和说明为准。 * 先安装依赖 ``` apt install build essential cmake python3 sshpass git ``` > sshpass 也可以不安装， build essential, cmake, git, python3 必须安装 * 克隆仓库到本地或者开发板 ``` git clone https://github.com/sipeed/libmaix recursive ``` >! 注意 ` recursive` 参数是必须的，用以克隆子模块，否则会缺代码。 这里以在开发板上编译为例： ```bash cd /home/libmaix # git clone https://github.com/sipeed/libmaix recursive cd examples/axpi python3 project.py distclean # python3 project.py menuconfig # 可以配置相关参数 python3 project.py build # 如果增加文件了，需要 python3 project.py rebuild 命令 ./dist/start_app.sh # 运行示例程序 ``` > ### ax samples Repository: [Click me](https://github.com/AXERA TECH/ax samples) This SDK has been set in `/home` path of AXera Pi, read [ax samples](https://github.com/AXERA TECH/ax samples) for more help. ```bash cd /home/ax samples # git clone https://github.com/AXERA TECH/ax samples.git mkdir build cd build cmake .. make install ``` THen we get the executable program, which is in `ax samples/build/install/bin/` directory ### [axpi_bsp_sdk](https://github.com/sipeed/axpi_bsp_sdk) Repository: [Click me](https://github.com/sipeed/axpi_bsp_sdk) Read [readme](https://github.com/sipeed/axpi_bsp_sdk/blob/main/readme.md) for more information, and read document here [Click me](https://github.com/sipeed/axpi_bsp_sdk/tree/main/docs). The `on pc` of `run your program` [readme](https://github.com/sipeed/axpi_bsp_sdk/blob/main/readme.md) is sending the executable program to AXera Pi first, then run it. ## SDK with AI To load AI vision model, we need to use camera, screen and AI model. Here are several Repositories which can help you this. ### Build with libmaix (Easy for developmrnt, for quick verification) [axpi libmaix](https://github.com/sipeed/libmaix/tree/release/examples/axpi) [axpi_classification_cam](https://github.com/sipeed/libmaix/tree/release/examples/axpi_classification_cam) [axpi_yolov5_cam](https://github.com/sipeed/libmaix/tree/release/examples/axpi_yolov5_cam) > 20221113 This SDK is only for test, no optimization include. ### Build with ax pipeline (Medium difficulty, for optimization) This SDK is based on `bsp sdk`(axpi_bsp_sdk), and with better performance.

Visit mega [Click me](https://mega.nz/folder/9EhyBbJZ#lcNhhm9aWXOyo2T0DDaSqA) to download the image file. ![debian](./assets/flash_system/debian.jpg) The file name ends with `img.xz` is the compressed system image file, and the other file name ends with `img.xz.md5sum` is the check file, which we use to check the compressed system image file. The name rule of compressed system image file is `Image provider` _ `Target chip` _ `Linux distribution` _ `Created time` + `img.xz` The check file should be used in Linux, and users using windows10 or windows 11 can use the wsl to prepare a Linux environment Run command `md5sum c *.md5sum*` in the path where compressed system image file and check file are to check the compressed system image file. Check succeeded Check failed ![md5sum_success](./../../../zh/maixIII/assets/flash_system/md5sum_success.jpg) ![md5sum_failed](./../../../zh/maixIII/assets/flash_system/md5sum_failed.jpg) If there is some thing with the compressed system image file, it will show FAILED. Normally we don't need to check the compressed system image file, this is only for those who need it. ### Burn image **Before burning the image, we need to do the following preparation:** A TF card with a storage capacity card over 8GB. It is recommended to buy an official image card, otherwise it may lead to a bad experience due to the bad performance of the TF card A card reader: It is recommended to use the card reader that supports USB3.0, this will save time on burning the system image card. [Etcher](https://www.balena.io/etcher/) application: Download the edition of this application suitable for your computer system. **Burning system image steps** Run [Etcher](https://www.balena.io/etcher/ \"Etcher\") application, click `Flash from file`, choose the compressed system image `img.xz` file， then click `Select target` to choose the TF card，click `FLASH` to burn your TF card. **Burn the TF card** ![burn_image_by_etcher](./../../../assets/maixIII/ax pi/burn_image_by_etcher.gif) Burning Finish burning ![axera_burning_image](./../../../assets/maixIII/ax pi/axera_burning_image.png) ![finish_flash](./../../../zh/maixII/M2A/assets/finish_flash.png) Note that after finishing burning the application shows `Flash Complete!` and `Successful`. Finishing the above steps, the computer will ask us to format the udisk, we just ignore this information and remove the TF card (Because we have made `Successful` in Etcher), prepare for the following operations. ### Burning Questions #### 1. After selecting system image, Etcher shows error. Rerun Etcher application to solve this error due to software cache or other issues #### 2. After finishing burning software the application shows FAILED not Successful Reburn the TF card. #### 3. The storage capacity of tf card is too small In this case, those who use Windows and MaxOS can use [SD Card Formatter](https://www.sdcard.org/downloads/formatter/eula_windows/SDCardFormatterv5_WinEN.zip) to format tf card, and those who use Linux can format the tf card by [Gparted](https://gparted.org/). ## Boot System Finishing burning system image into tf card, we can assemble this board and boot this device. ![axpi connect](./../../../zh/maixIII/assets/axpi connect.png) ### Assemble this board > Those who have bought the `Full board package` can skip these steps and visit [boot Axera pi] to start. **Preparation** An AXera Pi development board At least one USB3.0 connector to connect device(This board may fail to boot because of insufficient power supply from USB2.0) A tf card which has been burned system image GC4653 camera or OS04a10 camera The 5 inch MIPI screen suitable for Axera pi ![axpi config](./../../../zh/maixIII/assets/axpi config.jpg) **Follow these steps to make sure you assemble them correctly** 1. Set the screen and the board as shown in the image below, and connect them. 2. Insert tf card which has been burned system image into the card slot on Axera pi. 3. Connect the camera with Axera pi as shown in the image below, make sure you have removed the cover on the camera after finishing connecting. <html> <img src \"./../../../zh/maixIII/assets/mipi.jpg\" width 48%> <img src \"./../../../zh/maixIII/assets/sensor.jpg\" width 48%> </html> **Camera connection** There are 2 versions of camera, make sure the `1` on the camera matches the `1` on the board. Wrong connection will burn and destroy the camera. <img src \"./../../../zh/maixIII/assets/senror_v3751.jpg\" width 48%> <img src \"./../../../zh/maixIII/assets/sensor_v3753.jpg\" width 48%> Different onboard camera FPC connector needs different configuration, we use `CAM0` as the default one. ### Boot AXera Pi Connect both `USB UART` and `USB OTG` port with computer by USB type c cable to boot AXera Pi, make sure you have inserted the tf card which has been burned system image. ![start](./../../../zh/maixIII/assets/start.jpg) Because of the change of screen version, visit [bad display](https://wiki.sipeed.com/hardware/en/maixIII/ax pi/faq_axpi.html#Q%EF%BC%9AThe screen is blurred after booting) if your screen does not display the picture well. > In **20221013** we update the power on phenomenon: The 3.5mm stereo connector plays the music if connected with device. 5 inches screen displays picture. The logs are printed to USB UART port, run serial port application to see it if you need. Here are the drivers for CH340 which is the USB UART chip on Axera Pi, install it if you can't see the serial device on your computer. [CH34x Windows driver](https://dl.sipeed.com/shareURL/MAIX/tools/ch340_ch341_driver) [CH34x Linux driver](http://www.wch ic.com/downloads/CH341SER_LINUX_ZIP.html) If logs are not printed on serial terminal, press `RST` key on AXera Pi to restart device. And those who use Ubuntu22.04 may not be able to open serial port (ttyUSB), read [this](https://www.chippiko.com/ch340 dev ttyusb not showing) to see the solution. ![m3axpi_debian_boot_log_screenshot](./assets/flash_system/m3axpi_debian_boot_log_screenshot.png) `DRAM 1 GiB` in the log is not accuracy, in system we can check there is `2 GiB` memory. ## Login AXera Pi ![start](./../../../zh/maixIII/assets/start.jpg) > When the logo above is displayed on the screen of AXera Pi, the system has finished booting, and we can login to AXera Pi. ![axpi login](./../../../zh/maixIII/assets/axpi login.png) The first time to login to device, we need to use serial port application to open the serial port to communicate with the device to login, and using SSH login is also OK if you know the ip address of your board. [MobaXterm](https://mobaxterm.mobatek.net/) is a ultimate toolbox for remote computing, we use this software to run our command on the board for example. ![ssh](https://wiki.sipeed.com/hardware/zh/maixIII/assets/ssh.jpg) ### Login via serial port We take MobaXterm as an example serial port software, you can use your favorite one. In MobaXterm, we create a serial session. Set baudrate 115200, then click OK to create it. ![mobaxterm serial 4](./../../../../soft/maixpy3/zh/tools/assets/mobaxterm serial 4.png) Then click the created serial session to open the serial port to build communication. ![mobaxterm serial 5](./../../../../soft/maixpy3/zh/tools/assets/mobaxterm serial 5.png) Run the serial port application, use username `root` and password `root` to login. The password is not displayed when you enter it, so just retry if you fail to login. ![axera_pi_serial_root_login](./assets/flash_system/axera_pi_serial_root_login.jpg) ### Login by SSH To login by SSH, we need to know the ip address of Axera Pi. #### Traditional ip address We make Axera Pi and the computer in a same network environment, then run command `ifconfig` on Axera Pi to get the ip address of Axera Pi in this network environment. But you need to make sure you have connected Axera Pi to network, visit [Connect to network](#connect to network) to know how to connect to network. #### RNDIS Connect the computer with USB OTG port on Axera Pi. ![otg](https://wiki.sipeed.com/hardware/zh/maixIII/assets/otg.jpg) Normally RNDIS is driver free in Linux, and in Windows we need to update the driver [Click me](./rndis.html), for macos it needs to build and install `horndis` to use RNDIS. Deflaut RNDIS driver error in Windows: ![rndis_error_device](./assets/flash_system/rndis_error_device.jpg) Run command `ifconfig`, we can see there is a usb device with IP `192.168.1.233`, we'll use this ip address many times in the following content. ![ifconfig_usb_ip_address](./assets/flash_system/ifconfig_usb_ip_address.jpg) #### Login to board Up to now you have get one of your ip address, run command `ssh {username}@{ip address}` to connect to your board. Here we take the RNDIS ip address for example to connect Axera Pi by SSH, and the username is root, you can use other ip address or username you like if you have created the new user. ```bash ssh root@192.168.233.1 ``` ![ssh_rndis_connect](./assets/flash_system/ssh_rndis_connect.jpg) ## Connect to network Axera Pi connects to network via network cable or wireless module. ### Connect by Ethernet Connect the board ethernet port with a network gateway by network cable. Run command `ifconfig eth0` to see whether there is the ip address. ![nmtui_eth0_ifconfig](./assets/flash_system/nmtui_eth0_ifconfig.jpg) If there is no ip address of eth0 after connecting with network gateway, run command `dhclient eth0 &` to get the ip address manually. ![nmtui_eth0_dhclient](./assets/flash_system/nmtui_eth0_dhclient.jpg) And we can also use command `ifdown eth0` to disable Ethernet, and then use `ifup eth0 force` to restart Ethernet to get the ip address. ### Wireless network 1. Run command `ifconfig wlan0` to see whether there is the wireless device first, if there is no wireless device, visit [AXera Pi Q&A](https://wiki.sipeed.com/hardware/en/maixIII/ax pi/faq_axpi.html#Q%EF%BC%9ANo wlan0 shown in result after running command %3Ccode%3Eifconfig%3C/code%3E) to solve this problem. And only 2.4GHz wireless network is feasible. 2. Run command `nmtui connect` to open a wireless internet graphical interface. ![nmtui](./../../../../hardware/zh/maixIII/assets/nmtui.jpg) 3. Run command `ifconfig wlan0` to see whether there is the ip address. ![nmtui_wlan0_ifconfig](./assets/flash_system/nmtui_wlan0_ifconfig.png) Besides, Run command `nmcli device wifi connect Sipeed_Guest password qwert123` can also connect to wireless network, change the `Sipeed_Guest` into your wireless network name and change `qwert123` into your wireless network password. It will autoconnect to the wireless network when board boots. ## Config System ### System time Maix III AXera Pi uses the NTP protocol to update the system time. You can run the `date` command to get the current system time. > After connecting to Internet, system will automatically run `ntpdate debian` to update system time. #### Change timezone Maix III AXera Pi default timezone is GMT+8, you can change it with command `dpkg reconfigure tzdata` if necessary. ![system_time_timezone](./assets/flash_system/system_time_timezone.jpg) #### Update time Run `ntpdate debian` command after connecting Maix III AXera Pi to network to update time. ### Install application Based on debian, we can use `apt` to install the software on Maix III AXera Pi. Change the software resource if you think it's slow to download the software. Here we install `gcc`, `gparted`. ```bash sudo apt update sudo apt install gcc gparted ``` ![install_software_gcc_gparted](./assets/flash_system/install_software_gcc_gparted.jpg) ### Reboot/Shutdown device For Linux we suggest rebooting or shutting down the device by command line instead of disconnecting the USB cable or clicking the reset key, which may destory the file system. Run command `reboot` to restart device. ```bash reboot ``` Run command `shutdown` to power off device. ```bash poweroff ``` ### Resize system storage Run command `lsblk` to see the partition information, then resize the memory partition by command `cfdisk /dev/mmcblk2`. ![enlarge_memory_lsblk](./assets/flash_system/enlarge_memory_lsblk.jpg) Then the following similar interface shown, and we choose `/dev/mmcblk2p2` by arrow keyboard `↑` `↓`, select the `Resize` below by arrow keyboard `←` `→`. ![rizese mmcblk2](./../../../zh/maixIII/assets/rizese mmcblk2.png) The whole free space is resized by default, and you can enter your desired memory storage. ![new resize](./../../../zh/maixIII/assets/new resize.png) Enter your desired memory storage, and press Enter keyboard to save your temp change. Use arrow keyboard `←` `→` and choose `Write` to apply your change, and enter `yes` to confirm the change. ![write disk](./../../../zh/maixIII/assets/write disk.png) Use arrow keyboard `←` `→` and select `Quit` to quit the storage partition. ![quit](./../../../zh/maixIII/assets/quit.jpg) Finishing these, we run command `df h` to see the disk space usage, and we can see that the resized memory storage is not applied, we use command `resize2fs /dev/mmcblk2p2` to change the size of `mmcblk2`, and run command `df h` again to see the applied change. ![df mmcblk2](./../../../zh/maixIII/assets/df mmcblk2.jpg) > Run `reboot` if there is some trouble resizing the storage memory. ### Boot script The boot script is in `/boot` and named `rc.local`, you can edit it if you need. The boot script uses the root directory `/` by default, for example, if you want to run `/home/run.sh` at startup: 1. Use the absolute path to run the script background `/home/run.sh & `, if it's not running background we may not be able to control the board by command line anymore. 2. Use the relative path to run the script background `cd /home && ./run.sh &`, note that the path is different from the absolute path. Here is the default boot script. ```bash root@AXERA:~# cat /boot/rc.local ``` ```txt #!/bin/sh # this file is called by /etc/rc.local at boot. # systemctl stop usb gadget@g0 # mkdir p /mnt/udisk && mount /dev/sda1 /mnt/udisk # python3 /mnt/udisk/alltest.py # this control lcd backlight(50 ~ 1000) echo 0 > /sys/class/pwm/pwmchip0/export echo 1000 > /sys/class/pwm/pwmchip0/pwm0/period echo 500 > /sys/class/pwm/pwmchip0/pwm0/duty_cycle echo 1 > /sys/class/pwm/pwmchip0/pwm0/enable # wifi connect ssid Sipeed_Guest pasw qwert123 nmcli device wifi connect Sipeed_Guest password qwert123 if [ f \"/root/boot\" ]; then cd /root/ && chmod 777 * && ./boot & elif [ d \"/root/app\" ]; then cd /root/app && chmod 777 * if [ f \"./main\" ]; then ./main & elif [ f \"./main.bin\" ]; then ./main.bin & elif [ f \"./main.py\" ]; then python3 ./main.py & fi else aplay /home/res/boot.wav >/dev/null 2>&1 & /opt/bin/sample_vo_fb v dsi0@480x854@60 m 0 >/dev/null 2>&1 & sleep 0.8 && /home/fbv 1.0b/fbv /home/res/2_480x854.jpeg && killall sample_vo_fb & python3 c \"import os, binascii; os.system('sed i \\'/iface eth0 inet dhcp/ahwaddress ether {}\\' /etc/network/interfaces'.format(binascii.hexlify(bytes.fromhex(open('/proc/ax_proc/uid').read().split('0x')[1][: 5]),':').decode('iso8859 1'))) if os.system('grep \\'hwaddress ether\\' /etc/network/interfaces q') ! 0 else exit();\" & fi exit 0 ``` ![start](./../../../zh/maixIII/assets/start.jpg) From the boot script `rc.local`, we can see that `/home/res/2_480x854.jpeg` is what is displayed on the screen, and you can change it if you need. ### Update kernel and driver The first partition of system image card is mounted at `/boot` after booting, and replace with the file we can update the firmware to fit our hardware after rebooting the device. `boot.bin` spl initialize file `uboot.bin` uboot boot file `kernel.img` linux kernel `dtb.img` linux device tree For example: Update device tree: `cp /boot/dtb.img.lcd20221025 /boot/dtb.img` Update kernel `cp /boot/kernel.img.rtl8723bs /boot/kernel.img` Then reboot device to apply the new configuration. ## Transfer file > If you need to transfer file to AXera Pi, here are some ways to do this. ### SD card reader Because of the `ext4` format file system, those who use Windows/Mac can't open the file without other application, so it's only suggested to open the tf image card in Linux. And it's also a good idea to transfer by u disk connected to the USB OTG port on AXera Pi. ### Connect to computer #### Network SSH We have told the way to login AXera Pi by [SSH](#login by ssh), and with [mobaxterm](https://mobaxterm.mobatek.net/) it's really convenient to transfer files on Windows. Besides, login by ssh on [vscode](https://code.visualstudio.com/), we can transfer file by the Vscode Explorer. ![transfer_file_vscode](./assets/flash_system/transfer_file_vscode.jpg) Besides, we can not only use mobaxterm for file transfer, but also run X11 on this software if you login by ssh. This is an example of running gparted on Axera Pi with X11 on mobaxterm. ![transfer_file_mobaxterm](./assets/flash_system/transfer_file_mobaxterm.jpg) #### Serial communication If you connect the board with computer by [serial port](#serial communication), after installing the `lrzsz` application by command `apt get install lrzsz` after AXera Pi is connected to network, we can transfer it by `minicom` on Linux or [mobaxterm](https://mobaxterm.mobatek.net/) on Windows. ## Check the peripheral ### Built in application Maix III AXera Pi includes some Built in Linux applications, and they are in `ls /opt` directory. ```bash root@AXERA:~# ls /opt ``` ```bash bin include lib scripts share ``` And some resources are in the `/home` directory ```bash root@AXERA:~# tree L 1 /home ``` ```bash ├── ax samples # npu ai sdk bin # Ax example applications ├── examples # Ax example applications ├── fbv 1.0b # fbv picture viewer ├── images # Test pictures ├── libmaix # simple pipeline sdk ├── models # Built in AI models ├── res # Pictures and fonts ├── systemd usb gadget # Config usb service ├── usb uvc gadget # Config uvc service └── ustreamer # mjpeg application ``` We have put `gcc g++ gdb libopencv ffmpeg` into the Linux system image, with which we can compile the application on AXera Pi. Here is an example using libmaix： ```bash cd /home/libmaix/examples/axpi/ python3 project.py build fbon ./dist/start_app.sh ``` Screen displays the content of camera, if you failed running this application, visit [AXear Pi Q&A](./faq_axpi.html) to see how to switch camera. ![libmaix](./../../../zh/maixIII/assets/libmaix.jpg) The axsample has been compiled, and its joint models are in `/home/models/` directory for people to use. ```bash /home/ax samples/build/install/bin/ax_yolov5s m /home/models/yolov5s.joint i /home/images/cat.jpg r 10 fbon fbv yolov5s_out.jpg ``` Screen shows the yolovs_out.jpg picture file, `reboot` system if there is something occupying the system resources ![cat](./../../../zh/maixIII/assets/cat.jpg) Run `git pull` to get the latest libmaix code. ### Pin maps ![layout_axpi](./../../../zh/maixIII/assets/layout_axpi_1.png) ### RTC There is a RTC(Real Time Clock) on the ext board under the Core module, which provides the read time for Maix III AXera Pi when not accessed wireless. Use command `hwclock w f /dev/rtc0` to write current system time into RTC to adjust its time date. Run command `ls /sys/class/rtc`, we can see two rtc devices: `rtc0` and `rtc1`, `rtc0` is the Real Time Clock on the ext board and `rtc1` is the AXera Pi internal Real Time Clock. ![rtc0_data_time](./assets/flash_system/rtc0_data_time.jpg) ### CPU & RAM Default runs at 800MHz, and can be changed into 1GHZ. By command `ax_lookat`, we can get the values of memory. ![ax_look_at](./assets/flash_system/ax_look_at.jpg) Set cpu at 800MHz: ```bash root@AXERA:~# ax_lookat 0x01900000 s 33 ``` View cpu frequency: ``` root@AXERA:~# ax_clk AX620A: DDR: 3733 MHz CPU: 800 MHz BUS of VPU: 624 MHz BUS of NPU: 624 MHz BUS of ISP: 624 MHz BUS of CPU: 624 MHz NPU OTHER: 800 MHz NPU GLB: 24 MHz NPU FAB: 800 MHz NPU CORE1: 800 MHz NPU CORE0: 800 MHz ISP: 533 MHz MM: 594 MHz VPU: 624 MHz ``` Set cpu at 1GHz: ``` root@AXERA:~# ax_lookat 0x01900000 s 35 ``` View cpu frequency: ``` root@AXERA:~# ax_clk AX620A: DDR: 3733 MHz CPU: 1000 MHz BUS of VPU: 624 MHz BUS of NPU: 624 MHz BUS of ISP: 624 MHz BUS of CPU: 624 MHz NPU OTHER: 800 MHz NPU GLB: 24 MHz NPU FAB: 800 MHz NPU CORE1: 800 MHz NPU CORE0: 800 MHz ISP: 533 MHz MM: 594 MHz VPU: 624 MHz ``` ### VIDEO This is a demo for testing camera, visit [built in application](#built in applications) for more usages. gc4653 （Defaule camera） os04a10（Night enhanced camera） ```bash sample_vin_vo c 2 e 1 s 0 v dsi0@480x854@60 # For gc4653 camera # sample_vin_vo c 0 e 1 s 0 v dsi0@480x854@60 # For os04a10 camera ``` ![video](./../../../zh/maixIII/assets/video.jpg) > Those using os04a10 visit [AXera Pi](https://wiki.sipeed.com/hardware/en/maixIII/ax pi/faq_axpi.html#Q%EF%BC%9AHow to switch to os04a10 camera%EF%BC%9F) to see how to switch camera. ### DISPLAY Because of the change of screen version, visit [bad display](https://wiki.sipeed.com/hardware/en/maixIII/ax pi/faq_axpi.html#Q%EF%BC%9AThe screen is blurred after booting.) if your screen does not display well. Run command `sample_vo v dsi0@480x854@60 m 0` we can see there is colorbar on the screen to test the screen display, make sure you have disabled the framebuffer with command `fboff`, otherwise this `sample_vo v dsi0@480x854@60 m 0` will not work, and use command hotkey `Ctrl` + `c` to cancel the command is you want to stop running the application. #### Show a picture Now we use framebuffer (/dev/fb0) to control the camera content, run command `fbon` to enable the framebuffer, and `fboff` to disable the framebuffer. When `/dev/fb0` is enabled, we can display picture on the screen by command `fbv xxx.jpg`, and some pictures have been stored in `/home/res/` directory, display them by yourself. ![_home_res](./assets/flash_system/_home_res.jpg) ``` fbon # enable framebuffer fbv /home/res/logo.png # display picture fboff # disable framebuffer ``` ![fbv_logo](./../../../zh/maixIII/assets/fbv_logo.jpg) #### Play video We can play video via `ffmpeg`. The video should be `BGR format`, with `90° clockwise rotation` and `480*854 resolution`. If you think the video plays too fast, run `ffmpeg i /home/kun_1_output.mp4 vf \"setpts 2*PTS\" test3.mp4` to rebuild a slow video. ```bash fbon ffmpeg i /home/test3.mp4 pix_fmt rgba f fbdev /dev/fb0 fboff ``` In python we can run all commands above by `os.system()`. ```python import os os.system(\"fbon\") os.system(\"fbv /home/res/logo.png\") os.system(\"fboff\") os.system(\"fbon\") os.system(\"ffmpeg i /home/test3.mp4 pix_fmt rgba f fbdev /dev/fb0\") os.system(\"fboff\") ``` ### NPU The NPU examples are in the `/home/ax samples/build/install` directory, just run them to see their results. ```bash fbon /home/ax samples/build/install/bin/ax_yolov5s m /home/models/yolov5s.joint i /home/images/cat.jpg r 10 fbv yolov5s_out.jpg ``` ### AUDIO There is a 3.5mm audio connector on AXera Pi, we can use is to play or record audio, here are examples to test this peripheral, it's a bit loud, change the volume by `alsamixer`. ![alsamixer](./../../../zh/maixIII/assets/alsamixer.jpg) And these are examples: **Test command**：`speaker test t sine f 440 c1` **Record audio**: `arecord test.wav c 2 f cd d 2` **Play audio**：`aplay test.wav` And this is a python example to record and play the audio. ```python import pyaudio try: chunk 1024 # Each chunk will consist of 1024 samples sample_format pyaudio.paInt16 # 16 bits per sample channels 2 # Number of audio channels fs 44100 # Record at 44100 samples per second time_in_seconds 30 p pyaudio.PyAudio() stream p.open(format sample_format, channels channels, rate fs, frames_per_buffer chunk, input True, output True) # Store data in chunks for 3 seconds for i in range(0, int(fs / chunk * time_in_seconds)): data stream.read(chunk) stream.write(data) finally: # Stop and close the Stream and PyAudio stream.stop_stream() stream.close() p.terminate() ``` ### USB There is a USB OTG port on AXera Pi, we can change its function to be a OTG device or HOST device. #### USB OTG RNDIS We set this function as the default function of USB OTG port, with this we can see there is a usb RNDIS device in the device manager and we can login to AXera Pi by SSH with ip `192.168.233.1` if connecting the computer with AXera Pi via its USB OTG port. [Click me](#rndis) to know how to login with RNDIS by ssh. ![ssh usb](./../../../zh/maixIII/assets/ssh usb.jpg) The system enables amd starts this service by command `systemctl enable usb gadget@g0` and `systemctl start usb gadget@g0`, run command `systemctl disable usb gadget@g0` to disable this service or command `systemctl stop usb gadget@g0` to stop this service, by stopping this we can use this USB OTG port for other functions, we'll describe these in the following content. #### USB HOST Device Stop the RNDIS service with command `systemctl stop usb gadget@g0`, then run command `systemctl start usb gadget@g1` to set the USB OTG port as the HOST function, connect a USB device with the USB OTG port, run command `lsusb` to check the usb device. Here are the example logs(To read a usb storage device and mount it on AXera Pi). ```bash root@AXERA:~# systemctl stop usb gadget@g0 root@AXERA:~# lsusb Bus 002 Device 001: ID 1d6b:0003 Linux Foundation 3.0 root hub Bus 001 Device 002: ID 067b:2731 Prolific Technology, Inc.

Config the USER key first. ```bash echo 85 > /sys/class/gpio/export # export the USER key echo in > /sys/class/gpio/gpio85/direction # set the exported USER key direction ``` Get the USER key value ```bash cat /sys/class/gpio/gpio85/value # Get the value of USER key, 1 is unpressed and 0 is pressed ``` #### Blink a LED GPIO2 A4 68 A5 69 Export the LED IO and set its direction. ```bash echo 68 > /sys/class/gpio/export echo out > /sys/class/gpio/gpio68/direction ``` Set led IO voltage value to control the LED. ```bash echo 1 > /sys/class/gpio/gpio68/value sleep 1 echo 0 > /sys/class/gpio/gpio68/value sleep 1 echo 1 > /sys/class/gpio/gpio68/value ``` > Calculating Rule: GPIO2 A4 32 * 2 + 4 68 For Axera chip, GPIO0 means A IO port and GPIO2 means C IO port, and example like A4 is just a signal. GPIO2 A4 in AXera Pi is GPIO C(2) 4(A4) in standard definition , and standard definition GPIOA0 means IO GPIO0A4 in AXera Pi. In the future, we'll apply definition like PA0 and PC4, which is easier to understand. Here we use Python to control the GPIO, from the following figure, we can see that the BOT_GPIO_0 7 of the pin headers are GPIO2_A16_m GPIO2_A23_m in the system. ![io_pin_map](./../../../zh/maixIII/assets/io_pin_map.png) The relationship between PA0 3 and the figure above is as follows: ![](./../../../../hardware/zh/maixIII/assets/gpio_axpi.png) We use Python3 libgpiod to encapsulate gpio class. ```python try: from gpiod import chip, line, line_request config None # rpi is default value A 0 def gpio(gpio_line 0, gpio_bank \"a\", gpio_chip 0, line_mode line_request.DIRECTION_OUTPUT): global config if config !

If you can't detect your i2c device, make sure you have pulled up the data line. ```bash root@AXERA:~# i2cdetect y r 0 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 a b c d e f 00: 10: 20: 21 30: 36 40: 50: 60: 70: ``` The **0x21** 和 **0x36** in the log means there is a i2c device connecting to the `/dev/i2c 0` connector, and we can use command `i2cget` to read the data of the i2c device or command `i2cset` to write the i2c device. ### SPI ### CHIP ID Get the unique chip id of the main chip. ```bash cat /proc/ax_proc/uid ``` ### ADC ### Factory test script .. details::This is the factory test python script ```python test_flag False try: from gpiod import chip, line, line_request config None # rpi is default value A 0 def gpio(gpio_line 0, gpio_bank \"a\", gpio_chip 0, line_mode line_request.DIRECTION_OUTPUT): global config if config !

After clicking `Refresh` there is a IP Camera with IP `192.168.233.1`, choose it and click `Live` video to stream the video. ![onvif_rndis_device](./assets/flash_system/onvif_rndis_device.jpg) ![onvif_example](./assets/flash_system/onvif_example.jpg) And we just take RNDIS as example, other IP address like wireless or ethernet are also fine. Make sure your network is good, and bad network can not use `ONVIF Device Manager` with good experience. Switch model > `20221116` we set the different camera parameters in `run.sh` > `20221111` we set yolov5s face/object detection model in the system image, read the following content to see how to edit the script and switch model. ``` bash nano /home/examples/vin_ivps_joint_venc_rtsp_vo_onvif_mp4v2/run.sh ``` Run this command on AXera Pi, we can edit `run.sh` shell annotation `#` to switch model or load other model. Use hotkey `Ctrl + x` to save your changes. ![model save](./../../../zh/maixIII/assets/model save.jpg) Follow the instruction press `Y` to save modified buffer. And use the default file name. Run `run.sh` we can see different detection effects on the screen of Axera Pi. ![model file](./../../../zh/maixIII/assets/model file.jpg) **Press key and Record MP4** While running `run.sh`, click `USER` key to record video, and **LED0** is on when AXera Pi is recording. ![odm mp4](./../../../zh/maixIII/assets/odm mp4.jpg) Click `USER` key again to stop recording and **LED0** is off ![odm adb](./../../../zh/maixIII/assets/odm adb.png) The recorded mp4 files are in **`home/examples/`** directory. ![mp4 file](./../../../zh/maixIII/assets/mp4 file.png) ### PP_human Run following command on AXera Pi, screen displays the background picture, and when capturing a human, it will be shown on the screen. ```bash /home/examples/vin_ivps_joint_vo_pp_human_seg/run.sh ``` ![pp_human](./../../../zh/maixIII/assets/pp_human.jpg) Use the following command to edit the script file, change the annotation `#` to switch camera. ```bash nano /home/examples/vin_ivps_joint_vo_pp_human_seg/run.sh ``` Use hotkey `Ctrl + X` and follow instructions we save the change of editing. ![pp_human_adb](./../../../zh/maixIII/assets/pp_humana_adb.png) ### uvc_vo **usb uvc gadget**：[Github repository](https://github.com/junhuanchen/usb uvc gadget) This demo is not very stable. For the first time running this demo application, the usb otg rndis will change into usb otg uvc and lead to the device reboot. After that run this demo application again then everything is right. If your screen displays green interface, this means the wrong camera configuration, edit the script to switch camera. Before running this demo, connecting both USB UART and USB OTG port, we use USB UART port to control AXera Pi and use USB OTG to transfer uvc stream to the computer. Run the following command to start this demo application. ```bash /home/examples/vin_ivps_joint_venc_uvc_vo/run.sh ``` ![uvc_adb](./../../../zh/maixIII/assets/uvc_adb.png) Run your computer camera application to display the camera detection of AXera Pi. ![uvc_vo](./../../../zh/maixIII/assets/uvc_vo.jpg) The following command can be used to `start`, `stop` or `restore` `uvc demo. ```bash /home/usb uvc gadget/uvc gadget.sh #start/stop/restore ``` **Android phone uvc** This uvc demo application can also display on Android phone which support OTG mode. Download and install a USB camera application on the phone first. Connect USB OTG port with Android phone, and run `/home/examples/vin_ivps_joint_venc_uvc_vo/run.sh` on AXera Pi by USB UART or SSH to start uvc demo, and start the USB camera application on the Android phone, then the camera content displays both on AXera Pi screen and Android phone. ![uvc_phone](./../../../zh/maixIII/assets/uvc_phone.jpg) This demo can run at system finishing boot if it's written into [rc.local](#boot script) ### lvgl7 UI Run following command we can run this lvgl demo. ```bash /home/bin/sample_vin_ivps_joint_vo_lvgl c 0 ``` ![lvgi_adb](./../../../zh/maixIII/assets/lvgl_adb.png) <p align \"center\"> <iframe src \"//player.bilibili.com/player.html?aid 690497396&bvid BV1n24y1C7DN&cid 901748014&page 1\" scrolling \"no\" border \"0\" frameborder \"no\" framespacing \"0\" allowfullscreen \"true\"> </iframe> </p> ### Python API It's also good to program your application via python, read [Python on Maix III AXera Pi](https://wiki.sipeed.com/hardware/en/maixIII/ax pi/python_api.html) for more. ### Human Parts detection This demo has been built in system, run following command to experience it. ```bash ./home/run.sh ``` And there are many other models in this system, edit `run.sh` to load and test other models. ```bash sample_vin_ivps_joint_vo sample_vin_ivps_joint_venc_rtsp_vo ``` ```bash yolov5_seg.json yolov7.json yolox.json yolov5s_face.json pp_human_seg.json ax_pose.json hrnet_animal_pose.json hand_pose.json ``` Use command `nano /home/run.sh` to enable the model you want to try. And change the camera by edit ` c 2` to switch to another camera. ![ax_poes_sh](./../../../zh/maixIII/assets/ax_poes_sh.jpg) <p align \"center\"> <iframe src \"//player.bilibili.com/player.html?aid 647932316&bvid BV1Pe4y1W7n6&cid 901750338&page 1\" scrolling \"no\" border \"0\" frameborder \"no\" framespacing \"0\" allowfullscreen \"true\"> </iframe> </p> More built in examples There are more examples in `/home/bin`, run then if you want. ```bash root@AXERA:~# ls /home/bin sample_h264_ivps_joint_vo sample_v4l2_user_ivps_joint_vo sample_vin_ivps_joint_vo sample_vin_joint sample_rtsp_ivps_joint sample_vin_ivps_joint_venc_rtsp sample_vin_ivps_joint_vo_h265 sample_rtsp_ivps_joint_rtsp_vo sample_vin_ivps_joint_venc_rtsp_vo sample_vin_ivps_joint_vo_lvgl ``` Here is an example runnning `sample_vin_ivps_joint_vo_h265`, and ` c 2` means the camera choice. ```bash /home/bin/sample_vin_ivps_joint_vo_h265 c 2 ``` These are the command logs. ![sample](./../../../zh/maixIII/assets/sample.jpg) ### sherpa ncnn (Chinese and English speech recognition) #### Basic usage Open directory `/home/sherpa ncnn m3axpi`, here are the demos. ```bash cd /home/sherpa ncnn m3axpi ``` Chinese speech recognition ```bash ./sherpa ncnn alsa \\ ./sherpa ncnn streaming zipformer small bilingual zh en 2023 02 16/tokens.txt \\ ./sherpa ncnn streaming zipformer small bilingual zh en 2023 02 16/encoder_jit_trace pnnx.ncnn.param \\ ./sherpa ncnn streaming zipformer small bilingual zh en 2023 02 16/encoder_jit_trace pnnx.ncnn.bin \\ ./sherpa ncnn streaming zipformer small bilingual zh en 2023 02 16/decoder_jit_trace pnnx.ncnn.param \\ ./sherpa ncnn streaming zipformer small bilingual zh en 2023 02 16/decoder_jit_trace pnnx.ncnn.bin \\ ./sherpa ncnn streaming zipformer small bilingual zh en 2023 02 16/joiner_jit_trace pnnx.ncnn.param \\ ./sherpa ncnn streaming zipformer small bilingual zh en 2023 02 16/joiner_jit_trace pnnx.ncnn.bin \\ \"hw:0,0\" \\ 4 \\ greedy_search ``` English speech recognition ```bash ./sherpa ncnn alsa \\ ./sherpa ncnn conv emformer transducer small 2023 01 09/tokens.txt \\ ./sherpa ncnn conv emformer transducer small 2023 01 09/encoder_jit_trace pnnx.ncnn.int8.param \\ ./sherpa ncnn conv emformer transducer small 2023 01 09/encoder_jit_trace pnnx.ncnn.int8.bin \\ ./sherpa ncnn conv emformer transducer small 2023 01 09/decoder_jit_trace pnnx.ncnn.param \\ ./sherpa ncnn conv emformer transducer small 2023 01 09/decoder_jit_trace pnnx.ncnn.bin \\ ./sherpa ncnn conv emformer transducer small 2023 01 09/joiner_jit_trace pnnx.ncnn.int8.param \\ ./sherpa ncnn conv emformer transducer small 2023 01 09/joiner_jit_trace pnnx.ncnn.int8.bin \\ \"hw:0,0\" \\ 2 \\ greedy_search ``` Running the command above, speak to the MIC on AXera Pi or play audio, detection results are printed to terminal. ![sherpa](./assets/flash_system/axpi_english_audio_detection.png) #### Update sherpa ncnn You can update the speech model to get better experience. Open the directory `/home/sherpa ncnn m3axpi` first. ```bash cd /home/sherpa ncnn m3axpi ``` We need to enable the large files first, install `git lfs` in your Axpi, and enable it. ```bash sudo apt install git lfs git lfs install ``` Then clone the latest sherpa ncnn speech model, make sure you are in `/home/sherpa ncnn m3axpi` directory. ```bash git clone https://huggingface.co/marcoyang/sherpa ncnn streaming zipformer zh 14M 2023 02 23 ``` ![sherpa_ncnn_update_model](./assets/flash_system/sherpa_ncnn_update_model.png) Then you can run following code to test the model(Make sure you are in

For example, if the `MIC_D0` on the microphone array is connected to the pin labeled 25 on the K210 board, then the corresponding parameter in this code needs to be changed to `i2s_d0 25`, the other seven pins should be changed by the same way. Since configuration of everyone is different, there are no identical connection instructions for using jumper wires, modify the pin parameters individually, and don't forget to delete the comment before `mic.init(...). `(just delete `#`). > Make sure not use the pin which has been used for peripherals(Like camera pins or lcd pins should not bu used for this micarray pin), which will make amazing error. ### C code #### SK9822 driver codes For reference only, source：[github](https://github.com/sipeed/MaixPy v1blob/master/components/kendryte_sdk/src/sipeed_sk9822.c);

It forwards the array’s audio (via UAC2.0, 8 channels) and sends soundfield hotmap frames (via CDC ACM or UART) to a host PC or MCU. Common use cases include voice capture, noise suppression, beamforming, and soundfield visualization. UAC2.0 (USB Audio Class): 8 channels, PCM S16_LE, 48 kHz CDC ACM (USB virtual COM): 16×16 raw hotmap frames UART: 16×16 raw / HEX + pseudo color hotmap frames at 2,000,000 bps (suitable for MCUs) > This document is a user guide for MA USB8. It covers connection, device verification, audio capture, beamforming, how to read/parse hotmap frames, and common troubleshooting. ## Quick start ### Hardware and basic setup 1. Use a data capable 5V USB cable. 2. Connect MA USB8 to your host PC or to your MCU board via USB/USB2TTL. 3. Choose a mode: Preferred: USB (UAC2.0 audio + CDC ACM serial) — on PC you can get multi channel audio and hotmap frames together. Alternate: UART / USB2TTL (2,000,000 bps) — for MCU/embedded environments to get hotmap frames (HEX/pseudocolor) only. We recommend installing Audacity on your PC for testing/recording. Before proceeding, check: That the USB cable is firmly connected and the board is powered (check LEDs). That the device appears in your system (Linux: `/dev/ttyACM0` or `/dev/ttyUSB0`; Windows: look for MA USB8 audio/CDC device in Device Manager). ### Verify the device (Linux) After plugging in, run: `dmesg tail` — you should see `/dev/ttyACM0` and `SipeedUSB MicArray`. `lsusb` — to inspect device IDs. Check audio devices with: `arecord l` — you should find an 8 channel UAC device. `pactl list short sources` — PulseAudio users can check sources. ![](../../assets/modules/micarray_usbboard_bl616/dmesg.png) ![](../../assets/modules/micarray_usbboard_bl616/lsusb.png) ### Verify the device (Windows) Open Device Manager and confirm the device appears as a multi channel audio device and a CDC ACM serial port. Use software that supports multi channel UAC capture (e.g., Audacity configured with WASAPI) to record all 8 channels. ![](../../assets/modules/micarray_usbboard_bl616/devmgmt.png) ## Record 8 channels (UAC2.0) ### Linux (CLI) Find the card/device and record 8 channels using `arecord`: ```bash arecord l # find the card / device arecord D hw:1,0 f S16_LE c 8 r 48000 t wav d 10 test_8ch.wav ``` Extract and play one channel (e.g., CH6): ```bash sudo apt install sox sox test_8ch.wav ch6.wav remix 7 # sox uses 1 based channel indexing; `remix 7` extracts CH6 (zero based→1 based) aplay ch6.wav ``` Notes: Device indexes and channel mapping may vary between systems and drivers. Use `arecord l` / `aplay l` to confirm hw index and channel mapping. If Windows only shows 2 channels, use WASAPI in Audacity or use Linux for full multi channel capture. ### Audacity (GUI) 1. Open Audacity → Edit → Preferences → Devices, and select MA USB8 as the recording device. 2. Choose the number of channels (8) in the recording options. 3. Record and inspect the tracks; you can solo or export an individual channel as needed. ![](../../assets/modules/micarray_usbboard_bl616/audacity linux sine1k.png) **Windows: Use WASAPI to enable 8 channel capture** Windows requires using WASAPI in Audacity to expose all 8 channels — choose the MA USB8 device under WASAPI and select 8 channels. <div style \"display: flex; justify content: space between;\"> <img src \"../../assets/modules/micarray_usbboard_bl616/audacity windows wasapi step 1.png\" style \"width: 48%;\"> <img src \"../../assets/modules/micarray_usbboard_bl616/audacity windows wasapi step 2.png\" style \"width: 48%;\"> </div> ## Beamforming demo MA USB8 supports 12 beamforming directions: `0..9`, `A`, `B` (each step 30°). To point the beam to CH0 (0°) and monitor the beamformed output on CH6: 1. Open the CDC ACM serial device (e.g., `/dev/ttyACM0`) with a serial terminal: ```bash minicom D /dev/ttyACM0 H ``` 2. Type a single character (e.g., `0`) to set the beam direction to 0°. The beamformed audio will be output on CH6. 3. Record or play CH6 and confirm that sound from the selected direction is amplified and other directions are suppressed. Note: `0..9, A, B` map to angles `0°, 30°, …, 330°`. ![](../../assets/modules/micarray_usbboard_bl616/sine500hz@ch0_and_sine1000hz@ch3_with_beamforming@ch0.png) ## Observe hotmap frames (CDC ACM / UART) The board outputs hotmap frames via CDC ACM (`/dev/ttyACM0`) or via UART (`/dev/ttyUSB0` at 2,000,000 bps). ### Quick check with minicom / picocom CDC ACM (raw): ```bash minicom D /dev/ttyACM0 H ``` UART (picocom raw/hex): ```bash picocom b 2000000 imap 8bithex /dev/ttyUSB0 ``` In picocom, press `F` and then `C` to switch to HEX + color map (some versions/devices). ![](../../assets/modules/micarray_usbboard_bl616/minicom_acm&picocom_uart combine.png) <div style \"display: flex; justify content: space between;\"> <img src \"../../assets/modules/micarray_usbboard_bl616/picocom_uart hex.png\" style \"width: 45%;\"> <img src \"../../assets/modules/micarray_usbboard_bl616/picocom_uart hex cmap.png\" style \"width: 45%;\"> </div> (Developer note: use `hexdump C` or `cat /dev/ttyACM0 hexdump C v head n 20` to validate frame structure manually.) ## Quick serial commands (user cheat sheet) Set beamforming direction: send `0..9`, `A`, or `B` to the serial port; CH6 will be the beamformed output. LED on/off: `e` (off) / `E` (on). Toggle 16×16 ASCII hotmap print: `f` / `F` (UART only). Other developer level commands are shown in the Developer Reference section. ## Troubleshooting Windows shows only 2 channels: This is either a Windows driver limitation or your recording software. Use WASAPI in Audacity or switch to Linux for full 8 channel capability. Cannot access serial device: user permission issue — add your user to the `plugdev` group or create a udev rule (see Developer Reference): ```bash sudo usermod a G plugdev $USER # Log out and log in again for the group change to take effect ``` CDC ACM does not output frames: Confirm the board is in CDC ACM + UAC modes (not only UAC). Close other applications that may occupy the serial port. UART output appears garbled: Ensure `2000000 bps` selection; use `picocom b 2000000` or `minicom b 2000000`. On Windows, ensure the correct USB serial driver for your adapter (e.g., CH340/CH341/CH552) is installed. ## Firmware Download the [firmware](../../assets/modules/micarray_usbboard_bl616/firmware/MA USB8 251201.bin) from the assets and follow the combo8 firmware update [guide](../logic_analyzer/combo8/update_firmware.html#Burn firmware): ## Developer Reference (protocol, code examples, full command list) ### Hotmap Frame Format frame bytes value head 16 16 × 0xFF data 16×16 256 bytes (one byte per cell, 0..255), row major order (HxW) Total packet length 16 + 256 272 bytes. The header is used for frame alignment and detection; payload is the 256 byte matrix of intensity values. ### Full command table Command Input (Lower/Uppercase: Off/On) Default Remarks Input Source Set UAC CH6 beam direction 0..9, A, B 0 angle value × 30° (0..B → 0°,30°,…330°). Corresponds to the clockwise direction starting from microphone 0 as per the [microphone array](./micarray.html).

If hotmap frames don’t appear, ensure the device is not held by another program. UART (`/dev/ttyUSB0`) typically uses USB to serial adapters (CH34x/CH340/CH552); install proper drivers on Windows if necessary. That’s it — this English translation mirrors the Chinese guide and preserves the commands, examples, and images."},"/hardware/en/tang/Tang-Nano-1K/examples/lcd.html":{"title":"Drive RGB screen","content":" title: Drive RGB screen > Edit on 2022.04.19 ## Introduce timing RGB LCD display protocol is similar to VGA protocol, both have horizon synchronization signal line and vertical synchronization signal line. The main difference is that RGB LCD display protocol transfers by digital signal while VGA protocol transfers by analog signal. Here we introduce VGA timing. ![](./../../../../zh/tang/assets/examples/lcd_pjt_1.png) There shows horizon synchronization timing and vertical synchronization timing in the picture above. From the timing picture, we know both display a horizon of data or display a vertical of data, data transfers during the two synchronization signal pulses. Each horizon of data contains back porch, visible data **(this is normally thought as active data)** and front porch. The visible data is resolution we normally think, while the parameter of back porch and front porch depends on the resolution and frame rate. Its typical parameters can be found in this web. http://www.tinyvga.com/vga timing The timing of this 5 inch screen we sell is a bit different, its parameters can be downloaded here. [Detail book](https://dl.sipeed.com/fileList/TANG/Nano%209K/6_Chip_Manual/EN/LCD_Datasheet/5.0inch_LCD_Datashet%20_RGB_.pdf) For other size screen parameters, they can be downloaded here. [Click me](https://dl.sipeed.com/TANG/Nano%209K/6_Chip_Manual/EN/LCD_Datasheet/) The following picture shows the screenshot about this LCD timing. ![](./../../../../zh/tang/assets/examples/lcd_pjt_2.png) ![](./../../../../zh/tang/assets/examples/lcd_pjt_3.png) The first picture form shows parameters of the screen and the the following picture is its timing. From its timing picture, we can know we don't need to set front porch time and back porch time, we just need to set blanking time. ## Create project Please refer to this [article](./led/led.html) to see how to create project. ## Generate screen clock Here we use gowin official IP The crystal oscillator onboard is 27MHz, but our screen needs 33.3MHZ clock, so we need to use the corresponding ip core to generate the corresponding clock. Here we use `IP Core Generate` which can be find in Tools > IP Core Generate ![](./../../../../zh/tang/Tang Nano 1K/assets/Gowin_IP_rpll.png) Double click `rPLL` and select Verilog in the pop up window language, set CLKIN 27MHz, CLKOUTD is 33.00MHz. Also config the tolerance. ![](./../../../../zh/tang/Tang Nano 1K/assets/lcd_rpll.png) After click OK it asks whether add it to current project, here we choose yes. ![](./../../../../zh/tang/Tang Nano 1K/examples/led/assets/add_ip_file_in_project.png) Then a tmp file will appear, we can use it to generate the ip, like what is shown below. ![](./../../../../zh/tang/Tang Nano/examples/led/assets/ip_examples.png) ## Screen driver **To start this we should create a verilog file first** ### Port definition First define ports which are needed to drive screen ```verilog module VGAMod ( input CLK, input nRST, input PixelClk, output LCD_DE, output LCD_HSYNC, output LCD_VSYNC, \toutput [4:0] LCD_B, \toutput [5:0] LCD_G, \toutput [4:0] LCD_R ); ``` We use RGB565 driver mode. ### Timing constants Then we define the constants according to the timing form picture ```verilog localparam V_BackPorch 16'd6; //0 or 45 localparam V_Pluse \t 16'd5; localparam HightPixel 16'd480; localparam V_FrontPorch 16'd62; //45 or 0 localparam H_BackPorch 16'd182; \t localparam H_Pluse \t 16'd1; localparam WidthPixel 16'd800; localparam H_FrontPorch 16'd210; localparam PixelForHS WidthPixel + H_BackPorch + H_FrontPorch; \t localparam LineForVS HightPixel + V_BackPorch + V_FrontPorch; ``` First we define front porch, back porch and valid pixel data. As for the front porch timing and back porch timing which have been mentioned earlier, it can be combined into an erasing time, that is, one can be set to 0, and the other can be set to the erasing time. Anyway, the front porch timing and back porch timing can be added up to meet the timing requirements in the table is ok. ### Define variables Define some variables helps us to meet timing requirment ```verilog reg [15:0] LineCount; reg [15:0] PixelCount; reg\t[9:0] Data_R; reg\t[9:0] Data_G; reg\t[9:0] Data_B; ``` ### Synchronization signals This code generates synchronization signals. It should be noted that the synchronization signals of this screen enabled by negative polarity ```verilog always @( posedge PixelClk or negedge nRST )begin if( !nRST ) begin LineCount < 16'b0; PixelCount < 16'b0; end else if( PixelCount PixelForHS ) begin PixelCount < 16'b0; LineCount < LineCount + 1'b1; end else if( LineCount LineForVS ) begin LineCount < 16'b0; PixelCount < 16'b0; end else PixelCount < PixelCount + 1'b1; end always @( posedge PixelClk or negedge nRST )begin if( !nRST ) begin \t\t\tData_R < 9'b0; \t\t\tData_G < 9'b0; \t\t\tData_B < 9'b0; end else begin \t\t\tend \tend //Here note the negative polarity of HSYNC and VSYNC assign LCD_HSYNC (( PixelCount > H_Pluse)&&( PixelCount < (PixelForHS H_FrontPorch))) ? 1'b0 : 1'b1; assign LCD_VSYNC ((( LineCount > V_Pluse )&&( LineCount < (LineForVS 0) )) ) ? 1'b0 : 1'b1; ``` ### Enable signal This code decides whether display image. This driver needs a port which is set to 1 when the 800*480 data of the image is valid to enable display. ```verilog assign LCD_DE ( ( PixelCount > H_BackPorch )&& ( PixelCount < PixelForHS H_FrontPorch ) && ( LineCount > V_BackPorch ) && ( LineCount < LineForVS V_FrontPorch 1 )) ? 1'b1 : 1'b0; //It will shake if there not minus one ``` ### Test color bars This code generates color bars to test LCD ```verilog localparam Colorbar_width WidthPixel / 16; assign LCD_R ( PixelCount < ( H_BackPorch + Colorbar_width * 0 )) ? 5'b00000 : ( PixelCount < ( H_BackPorch + Colorbar_width * 1 )) ? 5'b00001 : ( PixelCount < ( H_BackPorch + Colorbar_width * 2 )) ? 5'b00010 : ( PixelCount < ( H_BackPorch + Colorbar_width * 3 )) ? 5'b00100 : ( PixelCount < ( H_BackPorch + Colorbar_width * 4 )) ? 5'b01000 : ( PixelCount < ( H_BackPorch + Colorbar_width * 5 )) ? 5'b10000 : 5'b00000; assign LCD_G ( PixelCount < ( H_BackPorch + Colorbar_width * 6 )) ? 6'b000001: ( PixelCount < ( H_BackPorch + Colorbar_width * 7 )) ? 6'b000010: ( PixelCount < ( H_BackPorch + Colorbar_width * 8 )) ? 6'b000100: ( PixelCount < ( H_BackPorch + Colorbar_width * 9 )) ? 6'b001000: ( PixelCount < ( H_BackPorch + Colorbar_width * 10 )) ? 6'b010000: ( PixelCount < ( H_BackPorch + Colorbar_width * 11 )) ? 6'b100000: 6'b000000; assign LCD_B ( PixelCount < ( H_BackPorch + Colorbar_width * 12 )) ? 5'b00001 : ( PixelCount < ( H_BackPorch + Colorbar_width * 13 )) ? 5'b00010 : ( PixelCount < ( H_BackPorch + Colorbar_width * 14 )) ? 5'b00100 : ( PixelCount < ( H_BackPorch + Colorbar_width * 15 )) ? 5'b01000 : ( PixelCount < ( H_BackPorch + Colorbar_width * 16 )) ? 5'b10000 : 5'b00000; ``` **Do not forget to add endmodule in the end of the driver file** Up to now we have finished the driver module. ## Instantiated in the top **New a verilog file** Just copy the content below and save it is ok ```verilog module TOP //Name TOP module ( \tinput\t\t\tnRST, input XTAL_IN, \toutput\t\t\tLCD_CLK, \toutput\t\t\tLCD_HYNC, \toutput\t\t\tLCD_SYNC, \toutput\t\t\tLCD_DEN, \toutput\t[4:0]\tLCD_R, \toutput\t[5:0]\tLCD_G, \toutput\t[4:0]\tLCD_B ); // list ports \twire\t\tCLK_SYS;\t \twire\t\tCLK_PIX; //instantiate pll Gowin_rPLL chip_pll( .clkout(CLK_SYS), //output clkout //200M .clkoutd(CLK_PIX), //output clkoutd //33.00M .clkin(XTAL_IN) //input clkin );\t \tVGAMod\tVGAMod_inst //instantiate vga driver \t( \t\t.CLK\t\t(\tCLK_SYS ), \t\t.nRST\t\t(\tnRST\t\t), \t\t.PixelClk\t(\tCLK_PIX\t\t), \t\t.LCD_DE\t\t(\tLCD_DEN\t \t), \t\t.LCD_HSYNC\t(\tLCD_HYNC \t), \t.LCD_VSYNC\t(\tLCD_SYNC \t), \t\t.LCD_B\t\t(\tLCD_B\t\t), \t\t.LCD_G\t\t(\tLCD_G\t\t), \t\t.LCD_R\t\t(\tLCD_R\t\t) \t); \tassign\t\tLCD_CLK\t\t \tCLK_PIX; endmodule ``` ## Synthesize, constrain, Place&Route ### Synthesize After finishing steps above, go to the \"Process\" interface, synthesize the edited file, which means running \"Synthesize\". ![](./../../../../zh/tang/Tang Nano 9K/nano_9k/nano_9k_synthsize.png) If the result is the same as shown below ![](./../../../../zh/tang/Tang Nano/assets/LED.png) It means that there is no bug in our code, we can continue the next steps. If there is some thing wrong, please fix by yourself. ### Constrain Here we only constraint pins The corresponding pins and ports are as follows form shows The way to constain pins can refer to the [Light led](./led/create_led.html), it contains two ways to constain pins. If you feel troublesome about the method above, you can copy the content in this [page](./../../../../zh/tang/Tang Nano 1K/examples/lcd_constrains.html)， and paste it in \".cst\" file in this project (If there is no \".cst\" file, just create a \"physicsl constrains file\").

The other 2 ways to new file are not mentioned here, In the pop up windows, we choose `Verilog File`, you can also choose `VHDL File` if you are good at it. Here we just use Verilog as an example. <img src \"./../../../../../../../news/others/20k_lite_start/assets/new_verilog_file.png\" width 50% alt \"new_verilog_file\"> Then click OK to set the file name, here we take `led` as the verilog file name as example. <img src \"./../../../../../../../news/others/20k_lite_start/assets/file_name.png\" width 75% alt \"file_name\"> Up to now we have finished creating file, then we need to prepare our code. ![created_file](./../../../../../../../news/others/20k_lite_start/assets/created_file.png) ### Verilog introduction Verilog is a kind of Hardware Description Language(HDL), it's used to describe digital circuits. The basic unit in Verilog is module. A module is composed of two parts: one describes the interface, and the other describes the internal logic function, that is, defines how the input affects the output. A module is like this: ```v module module_name #(parameter) (port) ; function endmodule ``` The module starts from module and ends by endmodule. The module is followed by the module name (module_name), transitable variable parameters (parameter), port and direction declaration (port), followed by internal logic function description (function), and finally, endmodule is used to represent this module. The internal logic function is usually composed by the assign and always blocks; The assign statement describes logical circuit, and the always block is used to describe timing circuit. ### Think storm Before coding, we need to think our purpose: The led flashes every 0.5S. Then we draw a demand block diagram as follows: ![block_method](./assets/block_method.png) Then we need a counter to time of every 0.5S, LED flashes means IO flip. ![count_block](./assets/time_count.png) Put the thought diagram into practical use, then it will look like this: ![clock_time_count](./assets/clock_time_count.png) The Clock is the clock source, providing the accurate time for the time counter. ### Code description From the verilog introduction and think storm diagram above, we can see the module we will create contains 2 ports: ```v module led( input Clock, output IO_voltage ); endmodule ``` For time counter inside module, crystal oscillator on the Primer 20K core board is 27MHZ, so we have 27 million times rising edges per second, and we just need to count 13500000 times rising edges to get 0.5 seconds. The counter starts from `0`, and to count 13500000 times rising edges, we count to 13499999. When counted to 0.5S, we set a flag to inform LED IO to flip its voltage. The overall count code is as follows: ```v //parameter Clock_frequency 27_000_000; // Crystal oscillator frequency is 27Mhz parameter count_value 13_499_999; // The number of times needed to time 0.5S reg [23:0] count_value_reg ; // counter_value reg count_value_flag; // IO change flag always @(posedge Clock) begin if ( count_value_reg < count_value ) begin //not count to 0.5S count_value_reg < count_value_reg + 1'b1; // Continue counting count_value_flag < 1'b0 ; // No flip flag end else begin //Count to 0.5S count_value_reg < 23'b0; // Clear counter,prepare for next time counting. count_value_flag < 1'b1 ; // Flip flag end end ``` The code to change IO voltage are as follows: ```v reg IO_voltage_reg 1'b0; // Initial state always @(posedge Clock) begin if ( count_value_flag ) // Flip flag IO_voltage_reg < ~IO_voltage_reg; // IO voltage flip else // No flip flag IO_voltage_reg < IO_voltage_reg; // IO voltage constant end ``` Combined with the codes above, it goes like this: ```v module led( input Clock, output IO_voltage ); /********** Counter **********/ //parameter Clock_frequency 27_000_000; // Crystal oscillator frequency is 27Mhz parameter count_value 13_499_999; // The number of times needed to time 0.5S reg [23:0] count_value_reg ; // counter_value reg count_value_flag; // IO chaneg flag always @(posedge Clock) begin if ( count_value_reg < count_value ) begin //not count to 0.5S count_value_reg < count_value_reg + 1'b1; // Continue counting count_value_flag < 1'b0 ; // No flip flag end else begin //Count to 0.5S count_value_reg < 23'b0; // Clear counter,prepare for next time counting. count_value_flag < 1'b1 ; // Flip flag end end /********** IO voltage flip **********/ reg IO_voltage_reg 1'b0; // Initial state always @(posedge Clock) begin if ( count_value_flag ) // Flip flag IO_voltage_reg < ~IO_voltage_reg; // IO voltage flip else // No flip flag IO_voltage_reg < IO_voltage_reg; // IO voltage constant end /***** Add an extra line of code *****/ assign IO_voltage IO_voltage_reg; endmodule ``` Because the `IO_voltage` is declared in the port position, which is wire type by default. To connect it to the reg variable `IO_voltage_reg`, we need to use assign. ## Synthesize, constrain, place&route ### Synthesize After finishing the code, go to the \"Process\" interface and double click \"Synthesize\" to synthesize our code to convert the verilog code content to netlist. ![Synthesize](./../../../../../../../news/others/20k_lite_start/assets/synthesize.png) ### Constraint After Synthesizing our code, we need to set constrains to bind the ports defined in our code to fpga pins, by which we can realize our module function on fpga. Click the FloorPlanner in the top of Synthesize to set constrains. ![FloorPlanner](./../../../../../../../news/others/20k_lite_start/assets/floorplanner.png) Since this is the first time we create it, the following dialog box will pop up. Click OK and the graphical constraint interface will pop up. ![create_constrain_file](./../../../../../../../news/others/20k_lite_start/assets/create_constrain_file.png) ![floorplanner_intreface](./../../../../../../../news/others/20k_lite_start/assets/floorplanner_interface.png) The ways to constraint the file can be get from this docs: [SUG935 1.3E_Gowin Design Physical Constraints User Guide.pdf](https://dl.sipeed.com/fileList/TANG/Nano%209K/6_Chip_Manual/EN/General%20Guide/SUG935 1.3E_Gowin%20Design%20Physical%20Constraints%20User%20Guide.pdf) Here we only use the IO Constraints method shown below to constrain the pins: ![floor_planner_ioconstrain](./../../../../../../../news/others/20k_lite_start/assets/floor_planner_ioconstrain.png) According to [Schematic of core board](https://dl.sipeed.com/shareURL/TANG/Primer_20K/02_Schematic), we can know the input pin of crystal oscillator is H11。 <img src \"./../../../../../../../news/others/20k_lite_start/assets/crystal_port.png\" alt \"crystal_port\" width 45%> Taking into consideration the IO screen printing on the ext_board, we decide to use the L14 pin on the ext_board for flashing. ![l14_port](./../../../../../../../news/others/20k_lite_start/assets/l14_port.png) So for the IO Constraints under the FloorPlanner interactive window, we fill in the following values for PORT and Location: ![io_constrain_value](./../../../../../../../news/others/20k_lite_start/assets/io_constrain_value.png) Finishing filling, use `Ctrl + S` to save constraints file, then close FloorPlanner interactive graphical interface. Then we see there is a .cst file in our project, and its content are easy to understand. ![cst_content](./../../../../../../../news/others/20k_lite_start/assets/cst_content.png) ### Place & Route After finishing constraining, we run Place & Route. The purpose is to synthesize the generated netlist and our defined constraints to calculate the optimal solution through IDE, then allocate resources reasonably on the FPGA chip. Double click Place&Route marked with red box to run. ![place_route](./../../../../../../../news/others/20k_lite_start/assets/place_route.png)。 Then there is no error, everything works well, we can burn our fpga. ## Burn bitstream It's suggested use this programmer application [Click me](https://dl.sipeed.com/shareURL/TANG/programmer) ro burn fpga. ### Connection comment The JTAG pin orders can be found in the back of 20K core board. <table> <tr> <td>Core Board</td> <td>5V0</td> <td>TMS</td> <td>TDO</td> <td>TCK</td> <td>TDI</td> <td>RX</td> <td>TX</td> <td>GND</td> </tr> <tr> <td>Debugger</td> <td>5V0</td> <td>TMS</td> <td>TDO</td> <td>TCK</td> <td>TDI</td> <td>TX</td> <td>RX</td> <td>GND</td> </tr> </table> ![cable_connect](./../../../../../../../news/others/20k_lite_start/assets/cable_connect.png) ### Scan Device Click `Program Device` twice to run Programmer application. ![open_programmer](./../../../../../../../news/others/20k_lite_start/assets/open_programmer.png) Click scan_device marked by red box to scan our device. ![scan_device](./../../../../../../../news/others/20k_lite_start/assets/scan_device.png) Click OK to burn fpga. ### Burn to SRAM Normally this mode is used to verify bitstream. Because of its fast burning characteristics so the use of more, but of course the power will lose data, so if you want to power on the running program you can't choose this mode. Click the function box below Operation to open the device configuration interface, then select the SRAM Mode option in Access Mode to set to download to SRAM, and finally click the three dots box below to select our generated `.fs` bitstream file . Generally speaking, bitstream firmware file is in the impl > pnr directory. ![sram_mode](./../../../../../../../news/others/20k_lite_start/assets/sram_mode.png) Click where the red box is to burn firmware. ![sram_download](./../../../../../../../news/others/20k_lite_start/assets/sram_download.png) Go to [Questions](https://wiki.sipeed.com/hardware/en/tang/common doc/questions.html) if you have any trouble。 Here we finished downloading into SRAM。 ### Burn into Flash Burning into sram is used for verifying biststream, but can't store program. If we want to run application at startup, we need to burn into flash. This steps are similar to the steps above of burning to SRAM. Click the function box below Operation to open the device configuration interface, then select the External Flash Mode in the Access Mode to burn into external Flash. Finally click the three dots below to select the.fs we generated to download the firmware. Choose the three dots box below to select our generated `.fs` bitstream file. Generally speaking, bitstream firmware file is in the impl > pnr directory. Finally, select the Generic Flash device from the following external Flash options. ![flash_mode](./../../../../../../../news/others/20k_lite_start/assets/flash_mode.png) Click where the red box is to burn firmware. ![flash_download](./../../../../../../../news/others/20k_lite_start/assets/flash_download.png) Then we can run our program when power on. ### Result After using PMOD designed by Sipeed，one led flashes like below. ![result](./../../../../../../../news/others/20k_lite_start/assets/result.gif) ## Question Go to [Questions](https://wiki.sipeed.com/hardware/en/tang/common doc/questions.html) if you have any trouble。"},"/hardware/en/tang/tang-primer-20k/examples/led.html":{"title":"Tang Primer 20K Dock Blink Led","content":" title: Tang Primer 20K Dock Blink Led tags: Tang Primer 20K Dock，start keywords: Primer, Tang, Dock， start，20K desc: Tang Primer 20K Dock start update: date: 2022 12 28 version: v0.1 author: wonder content: Init file To know a programming language, we start with `hello world`.

The module is followed by the module name (module_name), transitable variable parameters (parameter), port and direction declaration (port), followed by internal logic function description (function), and finally, endmodule is used to represent this module. The internal logic function is usually composed by the assign and always blocks; The assign statement describes logical circuit, and the always block is used to describe timing circuit. ### Blocking and Non blocking assignments In timing logic, there are two assignment symbols: ` ` and `< `. Note that `< ` means less than or equal to in the if statement, and is not an assignment symbol in the if statement. Visit the [difference between Blocking and Non blocking assignments](#difference between blocking and non blocking assignments) ### Think storm Before coding, we need to think our purpose: The led flashes every 0.5S. Then we draw a demand block diagram as follows: ![block_method](./lite/assets/block_method.png) Then we need a counter to time of every 0.5S, LED flashes means IO flip. ![count_block](./lite/assets/time_count.png) Put the thought diagram into practical use, then it will look like this: ![clock_time_count](./lite/assets/clock_time_count.png) The Clock is the clock source, providing the accurate time for the time counter. ### Code description From the verilog introduction and think storm diagram above, we can see the module we will create contains 2 ports: ```v module led( input Clock, output IO_voltage ); endmodule ``` For time counter inside module, crystal oscillator on the Primer 20K core board is 27MHZ, so we have 27 million times rising edges per second, and we just need to count 13500000 times rising edges to get 0.5 seconds. The counter starts from `0`, and to count 13500000 times rising edges, we count to 13499999. When counted to 0.5S, we set a flag to inform LED IO to flip its voltage. The overall count code is as follows: ```v //parameter Clock_frequency 27_000_000; // Crystal oscillator frequency is 27Mhz parameter count_value 13_499_999; // The number of times needed to time 0.5S reg [23:0] count_value_reg ; // counter_value reg count_value_flag; // IO change flag always @(posedge Clock) begin if ( count_value_reg < count_value ) begin //not count to 0.5S count_value_reg < count_value_reg + 1'b1; // Continue counting count_value_flag < 1'b0 ; // No flip flag end else begin //Count to 0.5S count_value_reg < 23'b0; // Clear counter,prepare for next time counting. count_value_flag < 1'b1 ; // Flip flag end end ``` The code to change IO voltage are as follows: ```v reg IO_voltage_reg 1'b0; // Initial state always @(posedge Clock) begin if ( count_value_flag ) // Flip flag IO_voltage_reg < ~IO_voltage_reg; // IO voltage flip else // No flip flag IO_voltage_reg < IO_voltage_reg; // IO voltage constant end ``` Combined with the codes above, it goes like this: ```v module led( input Clock, output IO_voltage ); /********** Counter **********/ //parameter Clock_frequency 27_000_000; // Crystal oscillator frequency is 27Mhz parameter count_value 13_499_999; // The number of times needed to time 0.5S reg [23:0] count_value_reg ; // counter_value reg count_value_flag; // IO change flag always @(posedge Clock) begin if ( count_value_reg < count_value ) begin //not count to 0.5S count_value_reg < count_value_reg + 1'b1; // Continue counting count_value_flag < 1'b0 ; // No flip flag end else begin //Count to 0.5S count_value_reg < 23'b0; // Clear counter,prepare for next time counting. count_value_flag < 1'b1 ; // Flip flag end end /********** IO voltage flip **********/ reg IO_voltage_reg 1'b0; // Initial state always @(posedge Clock) begin if ( count_value_flag ) // Flip flag IO_voltage_reg < ~IO_voltage_reg; // IO voltage flip else // No flip flag IO_voltage_reg < IO_voltage_reg; // IO voltage constant end /***** Add an extra line of code *****/ assign IO_voltage IO_voltage_reg; endmodule ``` Because the `IO_voltage` is declared in the port position, which is wire type by default. To connect it to the reg variable `IO_voltage_reg`, we need to use assign. ## Synthesize, constrain, place&route ### Synthesize After finishing the code, go to the \"Process\" interface and double click \"Synthesize\" to synthesize our code to convert the verilog code content to netlist. ![Synthesize](./../../../../../../news/others/20k_lite_start/assets/synthesize.png) ### Constraint After Synthesizing our code, we need to set constrains to bind the ports defined in our code to fpga pins, by which we can realize our module function on fpga. Click the FloorPlanner in the top of Synthesize to set constrains. ![floorplanner](./../../../../zh/tang/tang primer 20k/examples/assets/led_assets/floorplanner.png) Since this is the first time we create it, the following dialog box will pop up. Click OK and the graphical constraint interface will pop up. ![create_constrain_file](./../../../../zh/tang/tang primer 20k/examples/assets/led_assets/create_constrain_file.png) ![floorplanner_intreface](./../../../../zh/tang/tang primer 20k/examples/assets/led_assets/floorplanner_interface.png) The ways to constraint the file can be get from this docs: [SUG935 1.3E_Gowin Design Physical Constraints User Guide.pdf](https://dl.sipeed.com/fileList/TANG/Nano%209K/6_Chip_Manual/EN/General%20Guide/SUG935 1.3E_Gowin%20Design%20Physical%20Constraints%20User%20Guide.pdf) Here we only use the IO Constraints method shown below to constrain the pins: ![floor_planner_ioconstrain](./../../../../zh/tang/tang primer 20k/examples/assets/led_assets/floor_planner_ioconstrain.png) According to [Schematic of core board](https://dl.sipeed.com/shareURL/TANG/Primer_20K/02_Schematic), we can know the input pin of crystal oscillator is H11。 <img src \"./../../../../zh/tang/tang primer 20k/examples/assets/led_assets/crystal_port.png\" alt \"crystal_port\" width 45%> Taking into consideration the IO screen printing on the ext_board, we decide to use the L14 pin on the ext_board for flashing. ![led_port](./../../../../zh/tang/tang primer 20k/examples/assets/led_assets/led_port.png) So for the IO Constraints under the FloorPlanner interactive window, we fill in the following values for PORT and Location: ![io_constrain_value](./../../../../zh/tang/tang primer 20k/examples/assets/led_assets/io_constrain_value.png) Finishing filling, use `Ctrl + S` to save constraints file, then close FloorPlanner interactive graphical interface. Then we see there is a .cst file in our project, and its content are easy to understand. ![cst_content](./../../../../zh/tang/tang primer 20k/examples/assets/led_assets/cst_content.png) ### Place & Route After finishing constraining, we run Place & Route. The purpose is to synthesize the generated netlist and our defined constraints to calculate the optimal solution through IDE, then allocate resources reasonably on the FPGA chip. Double click Place&Route marked with red box to run. ![place_route](./../../../../zh/tang/tang primer 20k/examples/assets/led_assets/place_route.png) Then there is no error, everything works well, we can burn our fpga. ## Burn bitstream There is onboard programmer for downloading bitstream, and drivers have been installed when [install IDE](https://wiki.sipeed.com/hardware/en/tang/common doc/install the ide.html), we connect dock ext board with computer. ![connected](./../../../../zh/tang/tang primer 20k/examples/assets/led_assets/connected.png) ### Scan device Make sure you have enabled the core board first, put the 1 switch on the dip switch down. ![Enable_core_board](./../../../../../hardware/zh/tang/tang primer 20k/assets/start/switch_1_on.png) Double click `Program Device` to run Programmer application ![open_programmer](./../../../../zh/tang/tang primer 20k/examples/assets/led_assets/open_programmer.png) Click scan_device to scan device ![scan_device](./../../../../zh/tang/tang primer 20k/examples/assets/led_assets/scan_device.png) Click OK to finish selecting device. ### Burn to SRAM Normally this mode is used to verify biststream. Because of its fast burning characteristics so the use of more, but of course the power will lose data, so if you want to power on the running program you can't choose this mode. Click the function box below Operation to open the device configuration interface, then select the SRAM Mode option in Access Mode to set to download to SRAM, and finally click the three dots box below to select our generated `.fs` bitstream file . Generally speaking, bitstream firmware file is in the impl > pnr directory. ![sram_mode](./../../../../zh/tang/tang primer 20k/examples/assets/led_assets/sram_mode.png) Click where the red box is to burn firmware. ![sram_download](./../../../../zh/tang/tang primer 20k/examples/assets/led_assets/sram_download.png) Go to [Questions](https://wiki.sipeed.com/hardware/en/tang/common doc/questions.html) if you have any trouble。 Here we finished downloading into SRAM。 ### Burn into Flash Burning into sram is used for verifying bitstream, but can't store program. If we want to run application at startup, we need to burn into flash. This steps are similar to the steps above of burning to SRAM. Click the function box below Operation to open the device configuration interface, then select the External Flash Mode in the Access Mode to burn into external Flash. Finally click the three dots below to select the.fs we generated to download the firmware. Choose the three dots box below to select our generated `.fs` bitstream file. Generally speaking, bitstream firmware file is in the impl > pnr directory. Finally, select the Generic Flash device from the following external Flash options. ![flash_mode](./../../../../../../../news/others/20k_lite_start/assets/flash_mode.png) Click where the red box is to burn firmware. ![flash_download](./../../../../../../../news/others/20k_lite_start/assets/flash_download.png) Then we can run our program when power on. ### Result One led flashes like below. ![led_blink](./../../../../zh/tang/tang primer 20k/examples/assets/led_assets/led_blink.gif) ## End Up to now we have finished blinking led on fpga, and know how to use GOWIN IDE with fpga.。 ## Difference between Blocking and Non blocking assignments Write a simple codes and simulate it: ```v module test( input CLK, input [3:0] A, output reg [3:0] B,C,D,E ); always@(posedge CLK) begin B < A; C < B; D A; E D; end endmodule ``` ![simulation_result](./../../../../zh/tang/tang primer 20k/examples/assets/led_assets/simulation_result.png) According to the simulation results, we can see the difference between blocking and non blocking assignments by comparing the `B` `C` `D` `E` four results. `< ` is non blocking assignments, and all `< ` in a `always` run at the same time, this lead the result in green box, `B` is assigned the value of `A` while `C` is assigned the value of `B`, this happens at the same time, so `C` is assigned the old value of `B`, the value of `C` is one clock delay of `B`. ` ` is blocking assignments, all ` ` in a `always` runs sequentially. In this code, `D` is assigned the value of `A`, then `D` is assigned the value of `E`, so `D` and `E` are the same value. > In general, however, blocking assignment is not recommended in timing logic. And we get two results: Input data is not always valid, it depends on the clock edge. If the data is maintained for less than one clock cycle, it may regard useless data. Every time Triggering the edge clock, the `always` block runs from begin to the end, not runs from the middle. ## Questions ### No Cable found Check if there are two converters in device manager, reinstall programmer driver if there are no two converters in device manager. ![converter](./../../common doc/assets/questions/usb_converter.png) ### No gowin device found Make sure you have enabled the core board. ### Other questions Visit [Gowin errors to solve this problem](https://wiki.sipeed.com/hardware/en/tang/common doc/questions.html)"},"/hardware/en/tang/tang-primer-20k/example.html":{"title":"Tang Primer 20K examples tutorial","content":" title: Tang Primer 20K examples tutorial keywords: Tang Primer 20K ,example, guide update: date: 2022 10 17 version: v0.1 author: wonder content: Determine directory > All examples articles and github are continuing building, thanks for your understanding. ## LED Dock ext board contains 6 LEDs, we can do many things by them.

We have 2 ext board for Tang Primer 20K, the Dock and the Lite. Here I will tell the start of them ## Dock ext board ### Matters need attention Here are matters need attention, to avoid spending much time dealing with trouble and fail at last. #### Enable Core Board For 20K Dock kits, it's necessary to enable the core board before using debugger debug the chip, just put the 1 switch on the dip switch down, otherwise LED0 and LED1 are on and core board dose not work. Enable Core Board Disable state Additional comments <img src \"./../../../zh/tang/tang primer 20k/assets/start/switch_1_on.png\" alt \"switch_1_on\" width 100%><img src \"./../../../zh/tang/tang primer 20k/assets/start/reset_led_on.png\" alt \"reset_led_on\" width 100%> When disabled, the LDE0 and LED1 is on, and core board doesn't work. #### Device not work We have inserted the Core Board into Dock ext board before delivery, but sometimes we need remove the Core board for some reasons, and after reinserting the Core Board into Dock ext board, they don't work. The correct connection steps is to insert the Core board into the ext board at an Angle roughly as shown in the left figure below. Make sure that the Core board inserted diagonally from above is in uniform contact with the ext board, which can be judged by the degree of uniformity of the exposed gold finger. <img src \"./../../../zh/tang/tang primer 20k/assets/start/edge_view.png\" alt \"edge_view\" width 45%> <img src \"./../../../zh/tang/tang primer 20k/assets/start/top_view.png\" alt \"top_view\" width 35%> Then gently press the tilted end, you can hear a sound of the Core board being fixed by the ext board slot. If you find it difficult to press the tilted end, you can try to polish both sides of the Core board slightly to eliminate the size error caused by the production process. <img src \"./../../../zh/tang/tang primer 20k/assets/start/clean_core_board.png\" alt \"clean_core_board\" width 20%> Just polish the two sides of the red box in the figure above to reduce the difficulty of inserting. #### Hardware version introduction For Dock ext board, we can know the version of our board from the mark in the following picture. ![version](./../../../zh/tang/tang primer 20k/assets/start/dock version.png) From the figure we can know the version of this board is V3708. Here are their errors. ##### V3708 LED2 and LED3 are marked wrong, thay should be： Name Correct mask Wrong mask LED2 N16 B14 LED3 N14 N16 ### Start to use For Dock ext board, the following things can be done with default firmware. Press key S0, reset the RGB screen, camera, HDMI signal. And LED3, LED4, LED5 are on. Press key S0 to key S5, the state of LED0, lED1, LED2 changes. Connect OV5640 camera and 4.3 inch RGB screen with Dock ext board (Make sure power is off while connecting), the screen display the picture captured by camera. If the screen displays not well, try to press key S0, this will synchronize the camera picture and screen content. ### Start coding [Blink a led](./examples/led.html) ### Questions Visit [Questions](./../common doc/questions.html) for more solvements ## Lite ext board ### Hardware version introduction For Lite ext board，we can know the version of our board from the mark in the following picture. ![lite version](./../../../zh/tang/tang primer 20k/assets/start/lite version.png) From the figure we can know the version of this board is 3710.

You can short pin 1 and pin 4 of Flash, by which the chip cannot read FLASH normally when it is powered on. ![flash_cs](./../../../zh/tang/tang primer 20k/assets/flash_cs.png) Besides, if you have dock ext board, this can be solved by the enable pin of dip switch. Here art the steps Firstlt, enable the core board, put the 1 switch on the dip switch down, then do something (like burning fpga or erasing FPGA) in Programmer application, when the progress bar shows, switch the 1 switch on the dip switch up and down, after which you will find the progress bar works and finish your operations on fpga. <table> \t<tr> \t\t<td><img src \"./assets/start/switch_1_on.png\" alt \"switch_1_on\"></td> \t\t<td> Enable the core board first </td> \t</tr> \t<tr> \t\t<td><img src \"./assets/start/progress_bar.jpg\" alt \"progress_bar\"></td> \t\t<td> Do operation on board, when progress bar shows, switch the 1 switch on the dip switch up and down</td> \t</tr> \t<tr> \t\t<td> \t\t<img src \"./assets/start/switch_1_off.jpg\" alt \"switch_1_off\" witdh \"25%\"> \t\t<img src \"./assets/start/switch_1_on.png\" alt \"switch_1_on\" witdh \"25%\"> \t\t</td> \t\t<td> put the 1 switch on the dip switch up and down </td> \t</tr> \t<tr> \t\t<td><img src \"./assets/start/progress_bar_running.jpg\" alt \"progress_bar_running\"><img src \"./assets/start/progress_bar_finishing.jpg\" alt \"progress_bar_finishing\"></td> \t\t<td> Progress bar works and finish your operations on fpga </td> \t</tr> </table> ### Visit [Questions](./../common doc/questions.html) for more"},"/hardware/en/tang/Tang-Nano-4K/examples/led.html":{"title":"Blink LED","content":" title: Blink LED > Edit on 2022.04.15 From this essay we can learn the basic usage of Gowin IDE ## Create Project Create Project：File >NEW >FPGA Dsign Project >OK ![](./../../../../zh/tang/Tang Nano/assets/LED 1.png) Set project name and project path (File name and project path shoule be English) ![](./../../../../zh/tang/Tang Nano/assets/LED 2.png) Choose correct device: ![Tang_nano_4k_device_choose](./../../../../zh/tang/Tang Nano 4K/assets/Nano_4K_device_choose.png) The main chip model on some boards is C7/I6, please pay attention to this and choose correct model. ## Prepare codes After creating project, we can start editing codes.

Try using a better quality USB cable. Try another computer to rule out the computer being the problem. Try [update to the latest firmware](#How to update the firmware for the onboard debugger) and try again. ### The UART of the onboard debugger cannot be used Try reinstall FTDI drivers. IF the actual baudrate is always four times the set baudrate or the UART continuously outputs garbled characters. try [update to the latest firmware](#How to update the firmware for the onboard debugger) and try again. ### OpenFPGAloader not work Try [update to the latest firmware](#How to update the firmware for the onboard debugger) and try again. ### How to update the firmware for the onboard debugger See [Update the debugger](./../common doc/update_debugger) for details. ### After powering on the board, only four indicator lights on the dockboard are on, the SOM indicator light is not on 1. Please check if the board’s power has been turned on, press and hold the PWR button (next to the HDMI port) for 2 seconds to turn on the power. ### After powering on the board, the Battery Indicator light on the dcokboard is flashing 1. This is normal behavior, usually, the last LED (near the 12V DC connector) is flashing; 2. When the board is connected to a 3.7V lithium battery, these LEDs will serve as battery level indicators. ### After pressing and holding the PWR button for 2 seconds, all the indicator lights on the dockboard turn off and then light up in sequence 1. Check your power supply method, this situation means that the power supply is insufficient; 2. Solutions (choose one): a. Connect both the board’s **USB 3.0** and **USB DEBUG** for power supply, i.e., dual 5V USB power supply; b. Connect a 12V DC power supply to the board, if using the USB C to 12V DC connector from the accessories, a PD power source with 12V output capability is required; c. Connect a 3.7V lithium battery to power the board, note that the battery voltage must be ≥3.6V and the continuous discharge capacity must be ≥600mA. ### IDE cannot find the model GW5AST LV138PG484A 1. The GOWIN IDE version is too old. You must update to the commercial version IDE ≥ 1.9.9, or the educational version IDE ≥ 1.9.11.03. ### How to burn the bitstream to FLASH {#burn_flash} 1. Setting the **Programmer** as shown in the figure below: <img src \"./../assets/flash_mode_GAO.png\" alt \"flash_mode\" width 35%> 2. Check the position of the DIP switch; the correct position is shown in the figure below: <img src \"./assets/dip key_defualt.png\" alt \"dip key_defualt\" width 35%> ### No Response or Undesirable Pin Phenomenon After Burning 1. First, ensure that the IDE has selected the correct model **GW5AST LV138PG484AC1/10**; every parameter in the figure below **MUST** be consistent (for the [Device Version](../common doc/questions#How to Identify Device Version),please select according to the actual situation). <img src \"./assets/partno_138K.png\" alt \"device_choose\" width 35%> 2. Then, check your code and the corresponding simulation waveforms to meet the requirements. The GAO tools in GOWIN IDE maybe helpful.

</table>"},"/hardware/en/tang/Tang-Nano/examples/lcd.html":{"title":"Drive RGB screen","content":" title: Drive RGB screen > Edit on 2022.04.18 ## Introduce timing RGB LCD display protocol is similar to VGA protocol, both have horizon synchronization signal line and vertical synchronization signal line. The main difference is that RGB LCD display protocol transfers by digital signal while VGA protocol transfers by analog signal. Here we introduce VGA timing. ![](./../../../../zh/tang/assets/examples/lcd_pjt_1.png) There shows horizon synchronization timing and vertical synchronization timing in the picture above. From the timing picture, we know both display a horizon of data or display a vertical of data, data transfers during the two synchronization signal pulses. Each horizon of data contains back porch, visible data **(this is normally thought as active data)** and front porch. The visible data is resolution we normally think, while the parameter of back porch and front porch depends on the resolution and frame rate. Its typical parameters can be found in this web. http://www.tinyvga.com/vga timing The timing of this 5 inch screen we sell is a bit different, its parameters can be downloaded here. [Detail book](https://dl.sipeed.com/fileList/TANG/Nano%209K/6_Chip_Manual/EN/LCD_Datasheet/5.0inch_LCD_Datashet%20_RGB_.pdf) For other size screen parameters, they can be downloaded here. [Click me](https://dl.sipeed.com/TANG/Nano%209K/6_Chip_Manual/EN/LCD_Datasheet/) The following picture shows the screenshot about this LCD timing. ![](./../../../../zh/tang/assets/examples/lcd_pjt_2.png) ![](./../../../../zh/tang/assets/examples/lcd_pjt_3.png) The first picture form shows parameters of the screen and the the following picture is its timing. From its timing picture, we can know we don't need to set front porch time and back porch time, we just need to set blanking time. ## Create project Please refer to this [article](./led/led.html) to see how to create project. ## Generate screen clock Here we use gowin official IP The crystal oscillator onboard is 24MHz, but our screen needs 33.3MHZ clock, so we need to use the corresponding ip core to generate the corresponding clock. Here we use `IP Core Generate` which can be find in Tools > IP Core Generate ![](./../../../../zh/tang/Tang Nano 1K/assets/Gowin_IP_rpll.png) Double click `rPLL` and select Verilog in the pop up window language, set CLKIN 24MHz, CLKOUTD is 33.00MHz. Also config the tolerance. ![](./../../../../zh/tang/assets/examples/lcd_pjt_5.png) After click OK it asks whether add it to current project, here we choose yes. ![](./../../../../zh/tang/Tang Nano 1K/examples/led/assets/add_ip_file_in_project.png) Then a tmp file will appear, we can use it to generate the ip, like what is shown below. ![](./../../../../zh/tang/Tang Nano/examples/led/assets/ip_examples.png) ## Screen driver **To start this we should create a verilog file first** ### Port definition First define ports which are needed to drive screen ```verilog module VGAMod ( input CLK, input nRST, input PixelClk, output LCD_DE, output LCD_HSYNC, output LCD_VSYNC, \toutput [4:0] LCD_B, \toutput [5:0] LCD_G, \toutput [4:0] LCD_R ); ``` We use RGB565 driver mode. ### Timing constants Then we define the constants according to the timing form picture ```verilog localparam V_BackPorch 16'd6; //0 or 45 localparam V_Pluse \t 16'd5; localparam HightPixel 16'd480; localparam V_FrontPorch 16'd62; //45 or 0 localparam H_BackPorch 16'd182; \t localparam H_Pluse \t 16'd1; localparam WidthPixel 16'd800; localparam H_FrontPorch 16'd210; localparam PixelForHS WidthPixel + H_BackPorch + H_FrontPorch; \t localparam LineForVS HightPixel + V_BackPorch + V_FrontPorch; ``` First we define front porch, back porch and valid pixel data. As for the front porch timing and back porch timing which have been mentioned earlier, it can be combined into an erasing time, that is, one can be set to 0, and the other can be set to the erasing time. Anyway, the front porch timing and back porch timing can be added up to meet the timing requirements in the table is ok. ### Define variables Define some variables helps us to meet timing requirement ```verilog reg [15:0] LineCount; reg [15:0] PixelCount; reg\t[9:0] Data_R; reg\t[9:0] Data_G; reg\t[9:0] Data_B; ``` ### Synchronization signals This code generates synchronization signals. It should be noted that the synchronization signals of this screen enabled by negative polarity ```verilog always @( posedge PixelClk or negedge nRST )begin if( !nRST ) begin LineCount < 16'b0; PixelCount < 16'b0; end else if( PixelCount PixelForHS ) begin PixelCount < 16'b0; LineCount < LineCount + 1'b1; end else if( LineCount LineForVS ) begin LineCount < 16'b0; PixelCount < 16'b0; end else PixelCount < PixelCount + 1'b1; end always @( posedge PixelClk or negedge nRST )begin if( !nRST ) begin \t\t\tData_R < 9'b0; \t\t\tData_G < 9'b0; \t\t\tData_B < 9'b0; end else begin \t\t\tend \tend //Here note the negative polarity of HSYNC and VSYNC assign LCD_HSYNC (( PixelCount > H_Pluse)&&( PixelCount < (PixelForHS H_FrontPorch))) ? 1'b0 : 1'b1; assign LCD_VSYNC ((( LineCount > V_Pluse )&&( LineCount < (LineForVS 0) )) ) ? 1'b0 : 1'b1; ``` ### Enable signal This code decides whether display image. This driver needs a port which is set to 1 when the 800*480 data of the image is valid to enable display. ```verilog assign LCD_DE ( ( PixelCount > H_BackPorch )&& ( PixelCount < PixelForHS H_FrontPorch ) && ( LineCount > V_BackPorch ) && ( LineCount < LineForVS V_FrontPorch 1 )) ? 1'b1 : 1'b0; //It will shake if there not minus one ``` ### Test color bars This code generates color bars to test LCD ```verilog localparam Colorbar_width WidthPixel / 16; assign LCD_R ( PixelCount < ( H_BackPorch + Colorbar_width * 0 )) ? 5'b00000 : ( PixelCount < ( H_BackPorch + Colorbar_width * 1 )) ? 5'b00001 : ( PixelCount < ( H_BackPorch + Colorbar_width * 2 )) ? 5'b00010 : ( PixelCount < ( H_BackPorch + Colorbar_width * 3 )) ? 5'b00100 : ( PixelCount < ( H_BackPorch + Colorbar_width * 4 )) ? 5'b01000 : ( PixelCount < ( H_BackPorch + Colorbar_width * 5 )) ? 5'b10000 : 5'b00000; assign LCD_G ( PixelCount < ( H_BackPorch + Colorbar_width * 6 )) ? 6'b000001: ( PixelCount < ( H_BackPorch + Colorbar_width * 7 )) ? 6'b000010: ( PixelCount < ( H_BackPorch + Colorbar_width * 8 )) ? 6'b000100: ( PixelCount < ( H_BackPorch + Colorbar_width * 9 )) ? 6'b001000: ( PixelCount < ( H_BackPorch + Colorbar_width * 10 )) ? 6'b010000: ( PixelCount < ( H_BackPorch + Colorbar_width * 11 )) ? 6'b100000: 6'b000000; assign LCD_B ( PixelCount < ( H_BackPorch + Colorbar_width * 12 )) ? 5'b00001 : ( PixelCount < ( H_BackPorch + Colorbar_width * 13 )) ? 5'b00010 : ( PixelCount < ( H_BackPorch + Colorbar_width * 14 )) ? 5'b00100 : ( PixelCount < ( H_BackPorch + Colorbar_width * 15 )) ? 5'b01000 : ( PixelCount < ( H_BackPorch + Colorbar_width * 16 )) ? 5'b10000 : 5'b00000; ``` **Do not forget to add endmodule in the end of the driver file** Up to now we have finished the driver module. ## Instantiated in the top **New a verilog file** Just copy the content below and save it is ok ```verilog module TOP //Name TOP module ( \tinput\t\t\tnRST, input XTAL_IN, \toutput\t\t\tLCD_CLK, \toutput\t\t\tLCD_HYNC, \toutput\t\t\tLCD_SYNC, \toutput\t\t\tLCD_DEN, \toutput\t[4:0]\tLCD_R, \toutput\t[5:0]\tLCD_G, \toutput\t[4:0]\tLCD_B ); // list ports \twire\t\tCLK_SYS;\t \twire\t\tCLK_PIX; //instantiate pll Gowin_rPLL chip_pll( .clkout(CLK_SYS), //output clkout //200M .clkoutd(CLK_PIX), //output clkoutd //33.00M .clkin(XTAL_IN) //input clkin );\t \tVGAMod\tVGAMod_inst //instantiate vga driver \t( \t\t.CLK\t\t(\tCLK_SYS ), \t\t.nRST\t\t(\tnRST\t\t), \t\t.PixelClk\t(\tCLK_PIX\t\t), \t\t.LCD_DE\t\t(\tLCD_DEN\t \t), \t\t.LCD_HSYNC\t(\tLCD_HYNC \t), \t.LCD_VSYNC\t(\tLCD_SYNC \t), \t\t.LCD_B\t\t(\tLCD_B\t\t), \t\t.LCD_G\t\t(\tLCD_G\t\t), \t\t.LCD_R\t\t(\tLCD_R\t\t) \t); \tassign\t\tLCD_CLK\t\t \tCLK_PIX; endmodule ``` ## Synthesize, constrain, Place&Route ### Synthesize After finishing steps above, go to the \"Process\" interface, synthesize the edited file, which means running \"Synthesize\". ![](./../../../../zh/tang/Tang Nano 9K/nano_9k/nano_9k_synthsize.png) If the result is the same as shown below ![](./../../../../zh/tang/Tang Nano/assets/LED.png) It means that there is no bug in our code, we can continue the next steps. If there is some thing wrong, please fix by yourself. ### Constrain Here we only constraint pins The corresponding pins and ports are as follows form shows The way to constrain pins can refer to the [Light led](./led/create_led.html), it contains two ways to constrain pins. If you feel troublesome about the method above, you can copy the content in this [page](./../../../../zh/tang/Tang Nano/examples/lcd_constrains.html)， and paste it in \".cst\" file in this project (If there is no \".cst\" file, just create a \"physicsl constrains file\").

Tick Project > Configuration > Place&Route > Dual Purpose Pin which is in the Menu Bar. ![](./../../../../zh/tang/Tang Nano/examples/led/assets/enable_io_mux.png) Then we can run Place&Route. ## Program Finishing Place&Route, we can download the generated .fs file to the development board to see color bar. ## End Now the tutorial ends, if you have any suggestions, just leave a message. <p id \"back\"> <a href \"#\" onClick \"javascript :history.back( 1);\">Back to the previous page(Back)</a> </p>"},"/hardware/en/tang/Tang-Nano/examples/led/github_led.html":{"title":"Blink by github project","content":"# Blink by github project First get sourcecode from github https://github.com/sipeed/Tang Nano examples Open led_prj.gprj file in Tang Nano examples\\example_led\\led_prj path Right click clean&Rerun all in process interface ![](./../../../../../zh/tang/Tang Nano/examples/led/assets/github_place&route.png) Then there is an error(This is a historical question, you can search it by yourself if you wonder it) Change configuration which can be found in Project > Configuration > Syntheize of top menu bar and choose GowinSyntheize.

The basic Verilog design unit is module, a module is build from 2 parts, one part describes the ports, another part describes the logic functions which show the relations between ports. Module is like a black box we normally said, we don't care what's inside the module, we only need to instantiate the module according to the input and output format defined by the module, provide input to the module, and let the module work on its own. A module is normally like following: ```v module module_name #(parameter) (port) ; Function description; endmodule ``` The module start with `module` and ends with `endmodule`. After declaring `module` we will declare the `module name`, then we can set `parameter` to make our module change automaticly to meet out depmands. Then `Port` is the singal dealing with this module.`Function description` is a kind of description how we will realize our depmands. There are 2 signal types in a module, wire type and reg type. `Function description` contains `always` and `assign` 2 functions. `assign` function is used for describing combinatorial logic. `alyays` function can be used for describing combinatorial logic, as well as timing logic. ### Example codes ~~~v module led ( input sys_clk, input sys_rst_n, output reg [2:0] led // 110 B, 101 R, 011 G ); reg [23:0] counter; always @(posedge sys_clk or negedge sys_rst_n) begin if (!sys_rst_n) counter < 24'd0; else if (counter < 24'd1199_9999) // 0.5s delay counter < counter + 1'b1; else counter < 24'd0; end always @(posedge sys_clk or negedge sys_rst_n) begin if (!sys_rst_n) led < 3'b110; else if (counter 24'd1199_9999) // 0.5s delay led[2:0] < {led[1:0],led[2]}; else led < led; end endmodule ~~~ ## Synthesize, constrain, place&route ### Synthesize After finishing steps above, go to the \"Process\" interface, synthesize the edited file, which means running \"Synthesize\". ![](./../../../../../zh/tang/Tang Nano 9K/nano_9k/nano_9k_synthsize.png) If the result is the same as shown below ![](./../../../../../zh/tang/Tang Nano/assets/LED.png) It means that there is no bug in our code, we can continue the next steps. If there is some thing wrong, please fix by yourself. ### Constrain Clock constraint is not involved here To realize function of the code on FPGA, we must bind the ports we define with the chip pins. Double click the FloorPlanner in the Process interface to set pin constrain(This can be continued if failing Synthesize). ![](./../../../../../zh/tang/assets/examples/led_pjt_2.png) First time open FloorPlanner it will prompt lack of \".cst\" file, we just choose ok. ![](./../../../../../zh/tang/Tang Nano/assets/LED 9.png) The led schematic of nano is as shown below: ![](./../../../../../zh/tang/Tang Nano/examples/led/assets/nano_led_pins.png) In this GUI interface we have two ways to constrain pins: Drag the corresponding port to the pin of chip Type the pin number corresponding to the port in IO constraint(This is shown as below) So we can do the ordered operations in the opened window as what the following picture shows:(Just choose one way) ![](./../../../../../zh/tang/Tang Nano/examples/led/assets/pin_constrain_1.png) ![](./../../../../../zh/tang/Tang Nano/examples/led/assets/pin_constrain_2.png) ### Place&Route After finishing Running \"Place&Route\" in the Process interface window, the result will be as same as below ![](./../../../../../zh/tang/Tang Nano/examples/led/assets/RGB_LED_Place&Route.png) ## Program Then connect the board with computer, download firmware. Double click `Program Device` in Process interface to open programmer application ![](./../../../../../zh/tang/Tang Nano/examples/led/assets//Open_Programmer.png) You can config download mode according to the following picture. We use download to SRAM as an example. ![](./../../../../../zh/tang/Tang Nano/examples/led/assets/tang nano programmer config.png) If you need to store firmware with no power, just choose download to flash mode. ## End Now the tutorial ends, if you have any suggestions, just leave a message."},"/hardware/en/tang/Tang-Nano/Nano.html":{"title":"Tang Nano","content":"# Tang Nano > Edit on 2022.03.23 ## Introduction Tang Nano is a core board designed based on [Gowin](https://www.gowinsemi.com/en/) GW1N 1 FPGA chip.The board is equipped with PSRAM, RGB LCD interface and onboard USG JTAG debugger, which make it convenient for users to use. ![](./../../../assets/Tang/Nano/Tang_Nano.jpg) ## Parameters ![Nano](./../../../assets/Tang/Nano/Tang Nano 4.png) **Note** : The Numeric number matches PIN number Numeric number with dot matches gclk pins Items Specs Core GW1N 1 FPGA Logic units(LUT4) 1152 Registers(FF) 864 Block SRAM(bits) 72K B SRAM block 4 User flash(bits) 96K PLL 1 I/O Bank 4 I/O numbers 41 Core quantity 1.2V Usb Jtag ch552 Onboard PSRAM 64Mbits ![Nano Pin](./../../../assets/Tang/Nano/Tang Nano Pin.png) ## Support Email to support@sipeed.com for technical support and Business cooperation. ## Resources [Schematic](https://dl.sipeed.com/shareURL/TANG/Nano/HDK) [Download center](https://dl.sipeed.com/shareURL/TANG/Nano) [Examples](./../common doc/examples.html)"},"/hardware/en/tang/Tang-Nano/Tang-Nano.html":{"title":"Tang Nano examples","content":" title: Tang Nano examples ## Note Before reading, we suggest using this [Programmer](https://dl.sipeed.com/shareURL/TANG/Nano/IDE) named `programmer2.7z` not that installed with IDE ## Examples [Blink](./../common doc/examples/1_led.html)(Preparing, please wait) [LCD screen](./../common doc/examples/2_lcd.html)(Preparing, please wait)"},"/hardware/en/tang/tang-primer-25k/primer-25k.html":{"title":"Tang Primer 25K","content":"# Tang Primer 25K ## Overview Tang Primer 25K is a minuscule core board (23x18mm) designed based on [GW5A LV25MG121](http://www.gowinsemi.com.cn/prod_view.aspx?TypeId 74&FId t3:10:3&Id 188), accompanied by a 25K Dock base board that exposes all pins (excluding MIPI high speed pins).

Here is a brief step by step guide: Download and install the corresponding edition of the ***tools*** according to your OS. Get the updated debugger firmware for your board from [**Sipeed Download Station**](https://dl.sipeed.com/shareURL/TANG/Debugger/onboard). Refer to the official documentation of [**BouffaloLabDevCube**](https://dev.bouffalolab.com/download/) to update the firmware of the onboard debugger. For Windows users, there are detailed step by step tutorial below. Also, the steps for other operating systems are similar. *** ## Tutorial ### Preparation for Hardware To put the onboard debugger into **DFU mode**, press the ***Update Button*** or short the corresponding ***Test Points*** before power on the board or connecting the board's debug USB port with a cable.

Download and install the corresponding edition of the IDE according to your OS For linux users we suggested using Openfpgaloader to burn fpga. Read the end of this page [burn in linux](#burn in linux) for more details. ## Install the IDE ### Download the IDE The IDE can be downloaded from [this page](https://www.gowinsemi.com/en/support/download_eda/) after logging in. ![download_ide](../assets/download_ide.png) It may look difference as this screenshot is from 2023.05.29 and the IDE has since been updated. The IDE is available in two editions: Standard Edition and Education Edition. The Standard Edition IDE requires license, which you can get from GOWIN Semiconductor Corp. The Education Edition IDE is free to use, but supports fewer devices and includes fewer IP cores. The following figure (updated 2025/09/29) shows the part numbers (PN) supported in the latest Education Edition IDE ![educational_device](../assets/educational_device.png) The chips and boards in the following table can be synthesized and programmed via Educational IDE. The FPGA models of the Tang series boards currently on sale are as follows: Chip full name Chip SeriesChip model Board GW1NZ LV1QN48C6/l5 GW1NZ GW1NZ Nano 1K GW1NSR LV4CQN48PC6/l5 GW1NSR GW1NSR 4C Nano 4K GW1NR LV9QN88PC6/l5 GW1NR GW1NR 9C Nano 9K GW2AR LV18QN88C8/l7 GW2AR GW2AR 18C Nano 20K GW2A LV18PG256C8/l7 GW2A GW2A 18C Primer 20K GW5AT LV15MG132C1/l0 GW5AT GW2A 15A Primer 15K GW5A LV25MG121NC1/l0 GW5A GW5A 25A Primer 25K GW5AT LV60PG484AC1/l0 GW5AT GW5AT 60B Mega/Console 60K GW5AST LV138PG484AC1/l0 GW5AST GW5AT 138B/C Mega/Console 138K GW5AST LV138FPG676AC1/l0 GW5AST GW5AT 138B/C Mega 138K Pro All boards listed above, except the **Mega 138K Pro**, can be used with the Education Edition IDE. ~~For those who want to use Tang Nano (Onboard jtag is CH552), you'll need to use the Standard Edition IDE and apply for a license from GOWIN Semiconductor Corp.~~ > **Notes** > Starting from July 2025, the chip model for both 138K packages (PG484A and FPG676A) will change from **GW5AST 138B** to **GW5AST 138C**. The older B version FPGA has been discontinued by the manufacturer. > For the C Version 138K, you must select **Device Version: C** in the IDE; otherwise, SSRAM cannot be used and unexpected compatibiliHow to Identify Device Version. > [**Click Here**](../questions#How to Identify Device Version) to see how to identify the **device version**. ### Install #### macOS For macOS, just download the DMG image of macOS edition IDE, double click the DMG file to mount it, then drag the `GOWIN_IDE.app` to your `Application` Folder. Because the GOWIN IDE DMG image is not signed, it may be blocked by macOS Gatekeeper. To proceed, you will need to manually allow it to run. When the warning dialog appears, open System Settings → Privacy & Security, then click “Open Anyway.” Alternatively, you can remove the quarantine attribute from the DMG via Terminal with: ```zsh xattr c <path to dmg> ``` After that, double‑click the DMG to mount and run it. #### Linux OS For linux, download the Linux edition IDE and decompress it, the executable file `gw_ide` is in the decompressed folder /IDE/bin/. Execute it on command line to run the GOWIN IDE. Remember to change the permission of the software to make it executable with `chmod + x` if running the software fails. #### Windows OS Simply download the software and install it. Making sure to install all components. <div> <img src \"../../../../zh/tang/common doc/get_started/assets/IDE 2.png\" width 45% alt \"install ide\"> <img src \"../../../../zh/tang/common doc/get_started/assets/IDE 4.png\" width 45% alt \"install programmer\"> </div> In the second picture, Gowin is the IDE which we will use to generate the bitstream file, and the Gowin programmer is what we use to burn it to the fpga. But the programmer installed with IDE does not match the USB Jtag we provide. So we suggest you visit [Tang questions](./../common doc/questions) to see how to replace programmer software with one will work better. <! so we recommand you use this [programmer](https://dl.sipeed.com/shareURL/TANG/programmer) to avoid situations such as failing downloading bitstream file. > After you finish installing IDE, you will need to install 2 drivers. ![install driver](../assets/ide install driver.png) After installing everything there will be an IDE icon, like the one below, on your desktop. ![IDE icon](../assets/ide icon.png) ## Use the IDE ### About the license License can be applied on the Gowin official website, or you can use the online Lic service provided by Sipeed. In the IDE, select Float Lic and fill in the following information: ~~~ Server 01 ip: 106.55.34.119 port: 10559 ~~~ if the ip not work, try use \"gowinlic.sipeed.com\" domain's IP. The Educational edition IDE does not require a license. The Standard edition IDE requires a license, which you should apply for from the Gowin official website, visit https://www.gowinsemi.com/en/support/license/ for more information, and there you will be able to make a choice of software between `GOWIN EDA` and `GOWIN GMD`. `GOWIN EDA` is what we use to program FPGA and the `GOWIN GMD` is what we use to program the hardcore or softcore in FPGA, so you should choose `GOWIN EDA` to get a license to run GOWIN IDE. ### Verify license When you run GOWIN IDE, a license manager message box will appear. Once you have a license file you can click `Browse...` and select your license file, then `Check` and finally `Save`. <img src \"../assets/IDE 13.png\" alt \"Browser lic\" width 45%> <img src \"../assets/check.png\" alt \"Check lic\" width 45%> Now you can use the GOWIN IDE. ### Programmer Because the Programmer installed with IDE may not match the USB JTAG we provide it may not work. So for Windows users we recommended using this [Programmer](https://dl.sipeed.com/shareURL/TANG/programmer) instead. For Linux users, go to the end of this page to see the section [burn in linux](#burn in linux) if you have issues with the Gowin programmer. ## Other It may take some time to receive a license. During this time we suggest you read the GOWIN Semiconductor Corp official documents, which are installed with the IDE. There are three things in the IDE installation path: IDE folder, Programmer folder, uninst.exe ![ide_folder](../../../../zh/tang/common doc/get_started/assets/ide_folder.png) **IDE** folder：Here I suggest you look in the **doc** folder, where many GOWIN Semiconductor Corp official documents are, as shown below. ![IDE](../../../../zh/tang/common doc/get_started/assets/doc folder.png) **Programmer folder**: There are also many documents here. ![programmer](../../../../zh/tang/common doc/get_started/assets/programmer folder.png) We suggest you delete the Programmer folder installed with the IDE and use this version [Click me](https://dl.sipeed.com/shareURL/TANG/programmer)，which can solve some issues. **uninst.exe**：This program uninstalls the IDE. ## Burn in linux [Click here](../flash in linux) is how to burn the development board in linux."},"/hardware/en/tang/common-doc/examples.html":{"title":"Tang Nano Examples","content":" title: Tang Nano Examples tags: Tang Nano, example, guide keywords: Tang Nano，example update: date: 2023 01 09 author: wonder content: Add Tang Nano 9K Lushay Labs link Here are Tang Nano series examples and continuously updated ## Preface Basic guide to use Tang FPGA. ## Tang Nano The onboard downloader is ch552 Github: https://github.com/sipeed/Tang Nano examples [Blink](./../Tang Nano/examples/led/led) [LCD screen](./../Tang Nano/examples/lcd) ## Tang Nano 1K Github: https://github.com/sipeed/TangNano 1K examples [Blink](./../Tang Nano 1K/examples/led/led) [LCD screen](./../Tang Nano 1K/examples/lcd) ## Tang Nano 4K Github: https://github.com/sipeed/TangNano 4K example [Blink](./../Tang Nano 4K/examples/led) (Basic tutorial) [Keyflag Blink](https://github.com/sipeed/TangNano 4K example/tree/main/key_blink)(github) [HDMI display project](https://github.com/sipeed/TangNano 4K example/tree/main/hdmi_720p)(github) [Display camera content on HDMI](https://github.com/sipeed/TangNano 4K example/tree/main/camera_hdmi)(github) Run GBA on Nano 4K ：https://github.com/Martoni/GbHdmi Litex on Tang Nano 4K : https://github.com/litex hub/litex boards Other example Blink by Cortex M3：[Github](https://github.com/verilog indeed/gowin_fpga_tutorials) ## Tang Nano 9K Github: https://github.com/sipeed/TangNano 9K example [Blink](./../Tang Nano 9K/examples/led) [LCD screen](./../Tang Nano 9K/examples/rgb_screen) [Examples of PicoRV](./../Tang Nano 9K/examples/picorv) [FPGA drives 1.14 inch SPI screen](./../Tang Nano 9K/examples/spi_lcd) HDMI display : [Examples of PicoRV](./../Tang Nano 9K/examples/picorv) Litex on Tang Nano 9K : https://github.com/litex hub/litex boards Powerful NeoRV32 riscv core on 9K: [NEORV32](./../Tang Nano 9K/examples/neorv32) Partner tutorials: <a href \"https://learn.lushaylabs.com/tang nano series/\"><img src \"./../../../zh/tang/common doc/assets/lushaylab_logo.png\" alt \"lushaylab_logo\" width \"35%\"></a> [Lushay Labs](https://lushaylabs.com/) are willing to make series around ethernet, graphics and GPU basics, and in the future there is 2 processor project.

If the character is **A**, then it is **Device Version: A**. If the character is **B**, then it is **Device Version: B**. If the character is **C**, then it is **Device Version: C**. ...and so on. This method applies to all **GOWIN FPGAs**. The following example shows the marking position for the **GW5AST** of the 138K Pro series. <!DOCTYPE html> <html lang \"en\"> <head> <meta charset \"UTF 8\"> <title>CSS Indentation</title> <style> .indent { margin left: 0ch; /* width of 0 characters */ } </style> </head> <body> <details class \"indent\"> <summary><font color \"#4F84FF\">Click here to view the 138K B FPG676A device version marking</font></summary> <img src \"./assets/questions/138K Pro Ver.B.png\"> </details> </body> <br> </html> ## Programmer Make sure there are 2 `converter` and `COM` device, this means the debugger works well. ![tang_bl702_device_convertor](./../../../zh/tang/common doc/assets/qusetions/tang_bl702_device_convertor.png) The debugger can be used for Jtag and UART, when using its uart function, Jtag is disabled. To solve this, replug the TypeC cable of your board to disconnect the uart connection. ### No `COM` devices If there is no `COM` device but 2 `converter` devices, right click `converter B` > `Properties` > `Advanced` > `Load VCP` , then Click `OK` and reconnect your USB device. ![tang_bl702_device_convertor_load_vcp](./../../../zh/tang/common doc/assets/qusetions/tang_bl702_device_convertor_load_vcp.png) ### No `convertor` device It takes 10 seconds for debugger loading the driver.

Visit [this programmer](https://dl.sipeed.com/shareURL/TANG/programmer) compressed file, download it and extract it, replace the programmer folder install with GOWIN IDE by this extracted file. If you don't know how to replace the programmer folder, just execute the programmer application in the extracted folder to download bitstream file instead of the programmer application installed with GOWIN IDE. If this problem still occurs after you use our recommended programmer application, try to rerun this application. If all attempts fail, see the begin of this documents about `converter`. ### Cable lost Reflash bitstream to solve this. This occurs when flashing bitstream, board and computer does not well disconnected. ### Cable open failed ![cable_open_failed](./../../../zh/tang/common doc/assets/qusetions/cable_open_failed.png) This means the programmer application does not detect the debugger, try this programmer application mentioned in [Error found](#error found).

This page covers installation instructions and has been verified on Ubuntu but may work on other linux distributions. The currently available package on Ubuntu is older ('openfpgaloader') and does not support the latest boards (i.e. tangnano20k), because of this compiling the latest git source is recommended and covered below (adapted from the official projects documentation: https://trabucayre.github.io/openFPGALoader/guide/install.html). ### Compiling openFPGALoader from git 1. Install build dependences 2. Clone the source code 3. Configure and compile the code 4. Install ```bash # Install build dependencies sudo apt get install libftdi1 2 libftdi1 dev libhidapi hidraw0 libhidapi dev libudev dev zlib1g dev cmake pkg config make g++ # compile git clone https://github.com/trabucayre/openFPGALoader.git cd openFPGALoader mkdir build cd build cmake ../ # add DBUILD_STATIC ON to build a static version # add DENABLE_UDEV OFF to disable udev support and d /dev/xxx # add DENABLE_CMSISDAP OFF to disable CMSIS DAP support cmake build . # or # make j$(nproc) # install sudo make install ``` ### Optionally install Udev rules Using the board may require root permissions if Uden rules are not used. If this is not done you will likely need to run `openFPGAloader` as root or with `sudo` each time. ```bash # Working in the openFPGAloader/ directory # Copy the Udev rules to the correct directory sudo cp 99 openfpgaloader.rules /etc/udev/rules.d/ # Reload the udev rules and activate them sudo udevadm control reload rules && sudo udevadm trigger # force udev to take new rule # Add the current user to the plugdev group sudo usermod a $USER G plugdev # add user to plugdev group ``` ### Flashing the board First ensure openFPGAloader detects the cable and device. ```bash $ sudo ./openFPGALoader detect # This command should be executed in the directory where you previously executed make install # The log of succeed running is shown below Jtag frequency : requested 6.00MHz > real 6.00MHz index 0: idcode 0x100481b manufacturer Gowin family GW1N model GW1N(R) 9C irlength 8 ``` Flash the bitstream to the device as shown below. The board name must be specified after the ` b` option, ` f` options means the file is programmed to the non volatile flash, without it it will be stored in SRAM but lost if the device loses power. ```bash $ sudo ./openFPGALoader b tangnano9k f ../../nano9k_lcd/impl/pnr/Tang_nano_9K_LCD.fs # b means target model，this can be found in the form below # f means download to flash，with it means download to sram # The last is what need to be downloaded, it should be the related .fs file # The log of succeed running is shown below write to flash Jtag frequency : requested 6.00MHz > real 6.00MHz Parse file Parse ../../nano9k_lcd/impl/pnr/Tang_nano_9K_LCD.fs: Done DONE Jtag frequency : requested 2.50MHz > real 2.00MHz erase SRAM Done erase Flash Done write Flash: [ ] 100.00% Done CRC check: Success ``` #### Board names You can find the list of supported tang boards using the command `openFPGAloader list boards grep tang`.

The MaixCAM Microscope Kit is ideal for soldering small components, observing biological specimens, focus stacking photography, and more. Explore various applications with this versatile kit! ### Single Lens Kit Includes only the 10mm tapered lens, 10mm spacer ring, and anti glare flocking stickers. It is suitable for handheld use or if you already have a universal microscope stand. ![Single Lens Kit](../../assets/maixcam/micro_lens.jpg) **Usage:** Unscrew the original MaixCAM lens and replace it with the tapered lens. For higher magnification, attach the 10mm spacer ring first, followed by the tapered lens. ![Lens Installation Method](../../assets/maixcam/micro_lens_install.jpg) The closer the lens is screwed inward, the lower the magnification, and the lens to object distance increases (up to ~10 cm). The farther the lens is screwed outward, the higher the magnification, and the lens to object distance decreases (down to ~1 cm). Installation Method Optical Magnification Field of View Suitable Objects 10mm tapered lens (fully inward) 0.25X 20.5x11.5mm PCBs, FPC soldering 10mm tapered lens (fully outward) 0.6X 8.5x4.8mm IC markings, fine soldering Tapered lens + 10mm spacer (inward) 1.0X 5.1x2.9mm IC chips, larger specimens Tapered lens + 10mm spacer (outward) 2.0X 2.56x1.44mm IC chip details, cells 1. The magnifications above are optical, not exaggerated marketing values like hundreds or thousands of times. 2. Field of view examples are based on GC4653. For OS04A10, scale proportionally by 3/1.8 1.67x. After installation, you can observe and capture images using the built in camera app on MaixCAM. For low light conditions, turn on the flashlight via the app. If glare occurs, trim the anti glare flocking and attach it to the inner side of the tapered lens. ![Anti Glare Flocking Suppression](../../assets/maixcam/xiaoguang.jpg) ### Manual Stand Kit Includes: 1. **Lens:** 10mm tapered lens, 10mm spacer ring 2. **Stand:** Precision aluminum alloy stand components 3. **Biological Specimen:** Onion epidermis specimen, white stage 4. **Extras:** Anti glare flocking ![Manual Stand Kit](../../assets/maixcam/focusing_stand_suit.jpg) Refer to the lens installation method above.

In theory, yes, but it’s quite complicated. This article will not go into detail for now, but just provides you with the possibility. If you’re not prepared to hit some roadblocks, you can assume it’s not supported. That said, you’re welcome to try, share your experiences, and contribute to this document. ## Brief overview of ISP tuning Simply put, the ISP loads configuration files and reads parameters at runtime (you can see many configuration files under `/opt/etc/` in the system, such as `sc850sl_hdr_4lane_sipeed_0716.bin`). We can use the chip vendor’s ISP tuning tool to connect to the development board for tuning. Once finished, you’ll get a configuration file that can replace the original one. The official chip documentation and tools are available on the [download site](https://dl.sipeed.com/shareURL/MaixCAM/MaixCAM2/Software/Tools). Just download, read, and use them."},"/hardware/en/maixcam/maixcam2_faq.html":{"title":"MaixCAM2 FAQ (Frequently Asked Questions)","content":" title: MaixCAM2 FAQ (Frequently Asked Questions) **If you can't find your problem below, you can also refer to [MaixPy FAQ](https://wiki.sipeed.com/maixpy/doc/zh/faq.html).** ## The product comes with a case, but I don’t need the case, screen, or camera. Can these be removed for mass production? Yes. The included case, screen, and camera are mainly for quick product and idea validation. For actual mass production, you can contact **Sipeed** ([support@sipeed.com](mailto:support@sipeed.com) or through the online store) to customize and remove certain components. Larger orders will receive better support. In addition, a **core board version** is also available. If you have PCB design capabilities, you can directly purchase the core board and design your own baseboard. ## Why does the 4GB RAM version show only 2GB in the system? The hardware has **4GB RAM**, but the memory is divided into **user space memory** and **system reserved memory**. In a **Linux** system, the memory you see with the `free` command is the **user space memory**. A large portion of the system reserved memory is allocated as **dedicated hardware memory**, for example for **model inference**, **camera**, **display**, etc. You can adjust the allocation ratio by modifying the value of `maix_memory_cmm 1` in the `/boot/configs` file. * ` 1` is the default value. * For example, if you change it to `3072` (no unit needed, the default unit is **MiB**), then **3072 MiB** will be reserved for models and other hardware usage, and the rest will be available for the **Linux system**. **A reboot is required for changes to take effect.** For more details, please refer to [MaixPy Memory Usage Guide](https://wiki.sipeed.com/maixpy/doc/en/pro/memory.html)."},"/hardware/en/maixcam/maixcam2_camera_lens.html":{"title":"MaixCAM2 – Camera and Lens Selection & Usage","content":" title: MaixCAM2 – Camera and Lens Selection & Usage ## Camera Sensors Officially Supported by MaixCAM2 Parameter \\ Model OS04D10 SC850SL OS04A10 Resolution & FPS 2568x1448\\@30fps (2K / 4MP) 3856x2176\\@60fps (10bit) (4K / 8MP) 2688x1520\\@30fps (2K / 4MP) Pixel Size 1.998µm x 1.998µm 2.0µm x 2.0µm 2.9µm x 2.9µm Sensor Size 5130.864µm x 2893.104µm 7841.6µm x 4454.4µm Lens Size 1/3\" 1/1.8\" 1/1.79\" Output Format 10bit RAW RGB 12/10/8bit RAW RGB 16/12/10bit RAW RGB Shutter Type Rolling Shutter Rolling Shutter Rolling Shutter CRA 12° 9° 9° FOV D90° H81° V51° D100° H87° V49° D100° H87° V49° Max Exposure 0.5s 45s Dynamic Range Linear mode 75dB<br>WDR mode > 100dB >120dB (2x/3x staggered HDR) SNR 39dB Sensitivity 5034 mV/lux·s 32,000 e /Lux sec (green pixel @ 530nm illumination) Operating Temp 30°C \\~ 85°C<br>Optimal 20°C \\~ 60°C 30°C \\~ 85°C<br>Optimal 20°C \\~ 60°C 30°C \\~ 85°C Application Lower resolution, lower heat, good image quality, suitable for general AI detection/recognition High resolution & clarity, higher heat High quality imaging, color night vision, HDR, higher heat > In terms of night vision performance, the pixel area of the OS04A10 is twice that of the SC850SL, and the SC850SL’s lens aperture allows roughly twice as much light as the OS04D10. Therefore, the ranking is OS04A10 > SC850SL > OS04D10. > However, a larger aperture results in a shallower depth of field — approximately 8 cm at a distance of 50 cm, and 60 cm at a distance of 200 cm. More sensor datasheets can be found on the [download site](https://dl.sipeed.com/shareURL/MaixCAM/MaixCAM2/Hardware/sensors). ## Lens and Mount Parameters & Replacement Each official camera module comes with a standard M12 lens. Note: Lens parameters vary by sensor. If you want to purchase different lenses, use the sensor specs above and the reference lens table below. Datasheets for more lenses and mounts are available at the [download site](https://dl.sipeed.com/shareURL/MaixCAM/MaixCAM2/Hardware/sensors). ⚠️ Actual lenses may differ slightly from the datasheet (e.g. OS04D10 and SC850SL default lenses don’t use `650 IR Cut` even though listed). Always go by actual parts. ### Lenses #### Official MaixCAM2 Kit Lenses ![SC850SL Lens](../../assets/maixcam/cam_len.png) Parameter \\ Model OS04D10 SC850SL OS04A10 Interface **M12** **M12** **M12** Diameter 12mm 12mm 12mm Thread Pitch 0.5mm 0.5mm 0.5mm FOV H 90°<br>V 81°<br>D 90° H 86.7°<br>V 48.8°<br>D 99.5° H 88°<br>V 49.9°<br>D 100.2° Distortion None 25.6% 25.6% IR Cut None None None Lens Size **1/3\"** **1/1.8\"** **1/1.8\"** CRA 12° 16.2° 16.2° TTL 22.28±0.2mm 22.28±0.2mm Focal Length **3.05mm** **4.9±5%mm** **4.9±5%mm** Back Focal Length 3.1mm 6.41±0.2mm 6.41±0.2mm Flange Distance 3.1mm **6.17±0.2mm** **6.17±0.2mm** F Number 2.5 1.65±10% 1.6±10% Lens Elements 2G2P 4G4P 4G4P Resolution Std. 4MP 8MP 4MP ### Focusing Default M12 lenses are **manual focus**. If the image looks blurry, rotate the lens until focus is achieved. Some lenses include a **lock ring**—loosen it before adjusting focus, then tighten it to secure. ### Zoom Default M12 lenses are **fixed focal length**—they support focusing (sharpness) but not zooming (optical magnification). If needed, purchase an **M12 zoom lens**, referencing the specs above. ### Replacing the Lens Choose another **M12 compatible** lens. Important factors: **lens length**, **mount height**, and **focal length**. To ensure proper focus: 1. **Focus before bottoming out:** Sensor to lens distance (at screw in) must ≤ flange distance. Otherwise, it can’t focus. 2. **Focus before falling out:** When focusing on close objects, lens may need to move outward (`v_d`). Ensure flange + `v_d` < mount height, or the lens will slip out before focusing. > If unsure, provide your sensor + mount specs to the lens vendor for confirmation. ### Mounts ![](../../assets/maixcam/cam_len_base.png) Mounts are generally **not replaceable** (glued to PCB). Choose lenses that fit the existing mount.

If you need IR capture, you must remove or replace the filter (not easy). ## Can I Replace the Sensor? In theory, yes. Official sensors are already tuned and plug and play. If you want a new sensor, you’ll need **sensor driver integration** experience and **ISP tuning**. The process is complex and **not covered in this doc**. ## Real World Camera Comparisons TODO:"},"/hardware/en/maixcam/index.html":{"title":"MaixCAM — Fast Deployment for AI Vision and Audio Projects","content":" title: MaixCAM — Fast Deployment for AI Vision and Audio Projects <script src \"/static/js/tailwind.js\"></script> <style> #content_body .h1 { font size: 2.2em; font weight: 800; } .flex_center { display:flex; flex direction: column; justify content: center; align items: center; } #content_body .card_item { color: #f0f5f9; background: linear gradient(90deg, #26d0ce, #1a2980); border radius: 1em; padding: 1em; margin: 1em 0.1em; } #content_body .card_item img { transition: transform 0.4s ease; } #content_body .item2 { width: 90%; align self: start; background: linear gradient( 45deg, #c471ed, #f64f59); } #content_body .item3 { width: 90%; align self: end; background: linear gradient( 45deg, #12c2e9, #c471ed); } #content_body .card_item:visited { color: #f0f5f9; } #content_body .card_item:hover { border radius: 1em; background: linear gradient(70deg, #26d0ce, #1a2980); padding: 1em; margin: 1em 0.1em; } #content_body .item2:hover { background: linear gradient( 20deg, #c471ed, #f64f59); } #content_body .item3:hover { background: linear gradient( 20deg, #12c2e9, #c471ed); } #content_body .card_item:hover > img { transform: rotate(10deg) scale(1.3) ; } .cams_wrapper { } .mask_wrapper { position: relative; } .mask { position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; } .item_name { font size: larger; font weight: 800; } #content_body .btn_blue { margin: 1em; color: white; font size: 0.9em; border radius: 0.3em; padding: 0.5em 2em; background color: #0b4294; } #content_body .btn_blue:visited { color: white; } #content_body .btn_blue:hover { margin: 1em; color: white; font size: 0.9em; border radius: 0.3em; padding: 0.5em 2em; background color: #082a5e; } #content_body .btn_red { margin: 1em; color: white; font size: 0.9em; border radius: 0.3em; padding: 0.5em 2em; background color: #a80202 } #content_body .btn_red:visited { color: white; } #content_body .btn_red:hover { margin: 1em; color: white; font size: 0.9em; border radius: 0.3em; padding: 0.5em 2em; background color:#630606; } .dark #content_body .card_item { color: #f0f5f9; } .dark #content_body a.card_item:visited { color: #f0f5f9; } .dark .card_item { background: #292929; } @media screen and (max width: 768px) { #content_body .item1 { flex direction: column reverse; } #content_body .item1 img { padding bottom: 1em; } #content_body .item2 { width: 98%; } #content_body .item3 { width: 98%; } } </style> </style> <div style \"width:100%;\" class \"flex_center\"> <!

Make sure to download the correct version based on your device model: * For `MaixCAM`, download `maixcam xxxx.xz`. * For `MaixCAM Pro`, download `maixcam pro xxxxx.xz`. Backup download link: [Sourceforge](https://sourceforge.net/projects/maixpy/files/) ## Prepare Flashing Tools Download [Etcher](https://etcher.balena.io/) (highly recommended), install and open it. For Windows, you can also use [Win32DiskImager](https://sourceforge.net/projects/win32diskimager/) or [Rufus](https://rufus.ie/) if Etcher doesn't work. ## Launch the Flashing Tool Normally, double click the application icon to launch it. If you encounter the error `Something went wrong. If the source image was previously compressed, please check if it's corrupted. Error spawning the child process`, it might be due to insufficient permissions. Right click the application icon and run it as an administrator. ## Flash the TF Card There are two ways to flash the TF card: * If the TF card already has a system installed (for example, if you purchased the official TF card package or previously flashed the card yourself), using the USB update method is quicker (and for MaixCAM, it avoids opening the case). * If you're using your own card and it has never had a system flashed, you must first use a card reader to flash it at least once. After that, you can use the USB to update the system. ### Method 1: Flash TF Card with a Card Reader 1. Remove the TF card, insert it into the card reader, and connect it to your computer. 2. Open Etcher, select the image file, choose the TF card, and click `Flash`. 3. After flashing, if the computer prompts with `You need to format the disk in drive G: before you can use it`, **do not** format the disk! This would erase the newly flashed system. Close the window, right click the disk, and select \"Eject\" to safely remove the TF card. 4. Insert the TF card into MaixCAM, power it on, and wait for the system to boot. The first boot may take a little longer, so be patient. ### Method 2: USB Update for TF Card Image **Note: USB can only update the system, not be used for the initial flash.** Ensure the TF card has already been flashed using a card reader and the **system is running properly** before using this method. * For **MaixCAM Pro**: 1. Power off MaixCAM Pro (for battery versions, long press the power button to shut down), keep the TF card inserted. 2. Press and hold the `user` button without releasing, then power on (connect the USB cable to the computer or press the power button on battery versions). Wait for the USB device to appear on the computer, then release the `user` button. 3. Open `Etcher`, select the image file, select the USB device, and click `Flash`. 4. After flashing, if the computer prompts with `You need to format the disk in drive G: before you can use it`, **do not** format the disk! Close the window, right click the disk, and select \"Eject\" to safely remove the TF card. 5. Restart the device and wait for the system to boot. The first boot may take a bit longer, so wait about 1 minute. During booting, do not disconnect the power to avoid corrupting any files (if this happens, you can reflash the image). * For **MaixCAM**: 1. Power off MaixCAM and keep the TF card inserted. 2. Press and hold the `user` button, connect the USB cable to the computer (or first connect the USB cable, then press and hold the `user` button, quickly press the `reset` button and immediately release `reset`). Wait for the USB device to appear on the computer, then release the `user` button. 3. Open `Etcher`, select the image file, select the USB device, and click `Flash`. 4. After flashing, if the computer prompts with `You need to format the disk in drive G: before you can use it`, **do not** format the disk! Close the window, right click the disk, and select \"Eject\" to safely remove the TF card. 5. Press the `reset` button or power the device back on and wait for the system to boot. The first boot may take a bit longer, so wait about 1 minute. During booting, do not disconnect the power to avoid corrupting any files (if this happens, reflash the image). > If you're unable to enter USB upgrade mode, the system files might be corrupted. Use a card reader to reflash the TF card. ## Important System Usage Notes ### Force Shutdown Other than using the `reset` button in special cases mentioned above, **do not press the `reset` button** during normal use, as this button forces a power cut. If the system is writing to the TF card at the time, it may cause system and data corruption. Similarly, forcefully unplugging the power or pressing `reset` is equally harmful. Always try to **shut down the system via software** before disconnecting the power. For normal use, you can perform a **software shutdown or restart** using the following methods: * Method 1: From the interface, go to `Settings` > `Power` for software shutdown or restart. * Method 2: Use the terminal command `poweroff` or `reboot` for software shutdown or restart. * Method 3: Other software methods, such as using `Python` with the command `import os;os.system(\"poweroff\")` for shutdown or restart. * Method 4: For MaixCAM Pro, long pressing the power button for 4 seconds will trigger a software shutdown via the `maix` module. Continuing to hold for 8 seconds will trigger a forced power off shutdown (firmware version > 4.8.0 supports this). ### File Writing and Data Loss The system uses a caching mechanism, so when your code writes to a file, it might be writing to memory first. The system will automatically write the data to disk after some time. If the power is cut during this time, the data may not be saved to the disk (TF card), and the next time you boot, the data may be missing. Solutions: * Avoid forcefully cutting power or pressing the `reset` button. Use software shutdown as explained above. * For important data, manually force the system to write the cached data to the disk. In `Python`, you can use `os.sync()` to tell the system to immediately write all cached files to disk. For other methods or languages, search for keywords like \"Linux flush data to disk\"."},"/hardware/en/maixcam/faq.html":{"title":"MaixCAM FAQ (Frequently Asked Questions)","content":" title: MaixCAM FAQ (Frequently Asked Questions) **If you can't find your problem below, you can also refer to [MaixPy FAQ](https://wiki.sipeed.com/maixpy/doc/zh/faq.html).** ## What's the difference between MaixCAM and LicheeRV Nano? MaixCAM can use the resources of LicheeRV Nano and SG2002, but **LicheeRV Nano and other SG2002 chip products cannot use software like MaixPy, MaixCDK, MaixVision, etc.** Please do not make a wrong purchase to avoid wasting time and money. If you want to quickly start developing applications, please choose MaixCAM. If you are a seasoned Linux developer and only want to develop based on the original SG2002 resources, you can choose LicheeRV Nano. ## Why is there no purchase link in the official AliExpress store? AliExpress may close the purchase link when it encounters a shortage of stock. The purchase link will be automatically opened when the stock is available. You can consult the official customer service. ## Power on Black Screen, No Display on the Screen * Check if the TF (micro SD) card is installed. * Check if the latest system image is burned onto the TF card (strongly recommended to update to the latest system image); see documentation for specific burning methods. * Check if the TF card is fully inserted into the TF card slot, ensuring there are no gaps and it is not loose. * Check if the screen and camera ribbon cables are correctly and securely connected; there should be no looseness. * Check if the power LED (red light) and the system operation status LED (blue light) on the board are lit. If the red light is off, consider hardware issues such as no power supply, insufficient power supply, or a damaged board. * Connect the board to a computer using a USB to TTL cable, open the serial port assistant on the computer, restart the board, and check the boot logs for any errors. > If there is no log output, try swapping the TX and RX wires. For MaixCAM, the orientation of the Type C to serial port adapter may vary, and TX RX might be reversed, meaning it does not support reversible plugging. The `UART0_TX` pin of the chip has a characteristic where the system cannot boot if TX is pulled low. Therefore, check whether any circuit connected to `UART0_TX` is pulling it low during startup. Simply releasing the pin and restarting the system should resolve the issue. Another issue is that all pins of the chip used in the MaixCAM must not have any current injected into them before power on. Otherwise, the circuit will malfunction and fail to start. For example, if the MaixCAM is connected to an external MCU via serial communication, and the MCU’s TX/RX pins are at a high level, it will inject current into the MaixCAM, preventing it from starting. Similarly, if the MCU's TX pin outputs a low level, making the RX pin of the MaixCAM low, the MaixCAM will also fail to start. **Solutions:** The simplest solution is to power on the MaixCAM first, then power on the MCU, or power them on simultaneously. If the MCU powers on first, you can connect a diode to the MCU's TX/RX pins to prevent current from flowing into the MaixCAM. Additionally, ensure that the MCU's TX pin is set to a floating input state. ## Stuck at Boot Screen, Unable to Enter System The issue could be caused by a problem with the application environment or hardware. You can follow the steps below to troubleshoot: * If there is important data on the card, first try to back up the data: * Try using MaixVision to scan and connect to the device. Use the file management function to back up important data. * If MaixVision cannot connect, use a card reader to back up the data. Since Windows might not directly display system contents, you can use DiskGenius to read the data. * Reflash the latest system. If the system boots successfully, it means the system files were corrupted, and it's not a hardware issue. * If reflashing the **latest** system image still doesn't resolve the issue, it might be a hardware problem. You can: * First check if the camera connection is normal. * Then inspect the PCB for any obvious issues, such as loose components, soldering problems, burns, or short circuits. * You can also try using a USB to TTL adapter to connect the computer to the board's serial port (A16/A17 pins). Open a serial port assistant on the computer, restart the board, and check the boot log for any errors. > If there's no log output, try swapping the TX and RX wires. For MaixCAM, the Type C to serial board might have reversed TX and RX, meaning it doesn't support both orientations for plugging in."},"/hardware/en/maixcam/assemble.html":{"title":"MaixCAM / MaixCAM-Pro Case","content":" title: MaixCAM / MaixCAM Pro Case ## Overview When you receive your MaixCAM, there are several accessories to **pay attention to**: * **Lens Cap**: Protects the lens during transportation.

The factory version comes pre assembled. However, if you need to replace the TF card or solder pin headers, you can attempt to disassemble it. Some points to note: * Ensure the device is powered off before disassembly. * There is a thermal pad between the CPU and the case. Be careful not to damage it during disassembly. * Be cautious not to damage the camera, touch, or display ribbon cables (which can be loose). Do not bend the cables. * Pay attention to the direction of the cables; do not insert them incorrectly. ### Replacing the TF Card in MaixCAM 1. Pry open the clips on both sides of the device to separate the front and back covers. ![](../../assets/maixcam/assemble 1.jpg) 2. Lift the shell holding the display to access the TF card. ![](../../assets/maixcam/assemble 2.jpg) 3. Before reinstalling the display, ensure the display ribbon cable is properly connected. If it is misaligned, reconnect it correctly. ![](../../assets/maixcam/assemble 3.jpg) ## MaixCAM Pro For MaixCAM Pro, disassembly is not recommended unless necessary. * First, you will need a hex screwdriver. * Unscrew the screws at the back to remove the rear panel. * To remove the PCB, carefully lift the display by prying the gaps (be aware of the ribbon cables behind the display to avoid damaging them). * You will see screws that hold the PCB in place. Once unscrewed, you can remove the PCB. If it is the battery version, the battery is located behind the display. **Note**: Removing the display will cause the adhesive between the display and the case to lose its stickiness. You will need to reapply adhesive to secure it properly."},"/hardware/en/maixcam/maixcdk.html":{"title":"Using MaixCDK on MaixCAM","content":" title: Using MaixCDK on MaixCAM ## Introduction MaixCDK is a C++ SDK designed for Maix series products, which makes it convenient for developers to quickly develop AI applications.

Make sure all volumes are complete and correctly named. ## System Boot Process (Overview) To help you understand, here’s a simplified version of the boot process: 1. On power up, the chip’s internal bootrom checks if the `boot/Func` pin is pulled low (the MaixCAM2 `Func` button pressed). If yes, it enters `AXDL` USB download mode and waits for AXDL software to communicate via USB for at least **5 seconds**. If not pressed, it proceeds to normal boot. 2. It then loads the **boot partition** firmware from internal EMMC storage (where the system and data are stored). This firmware also checks if `boot/Func` is pressed—if yes, it enters USB/TF upgrade mode; if not, it continues loading the system from EMMC. ## Flashing Methods ### Method 1: Flashing `.axp` System via USB to EMMC As mentioned earlier, there are three flashing methods. Here we’ll cover the first in detail. #### Launch AXDL Software Download [AXDL](https://dl.sipeed.com/fileList/MaixCAM/MaixCAM2/Software/Tools/AXDL_V1.24.22.1.7z).(Only have Windows version) Download [AXDL Driver](https://dl.sipeed.com/fileList/MaixCAM/MaixCAM2/Software/Tools/Driver_V1.20.46.1.7z), Run `DriverSetup.exe` after decompression to install the driver. If the driver can not be recognized, please try to restart the computer. Open the AXDL software interface. #### Preparing the System You should already have downloaded the `.axp` format system. Usually, two types are provided, e.g.: * `maixcam2 2025 09 01 maixpy v4.11.9.axp`: A **full** `.axp` system (\\~8GB). * `boot_parts_maixcam2 2025 09 01 maixpy v4.11.9.axp`: A **boot partition only** file (<50MB). This means you can: * Use AXDL once to flash the complete system, then boot and run directly. * Or, if you prefer USB/TF flashing but your boot partition is damaged (“bricked”), quickly restore just the **boot partition** with `boot_parts_xxx.axp`, then use Method 2 to flash the full system. #### Load and Flash the System File * Click the “Load System File” button and select your `.axp` system file. * After loading, click “Start” to begin USB detection. * Hold the `boot/Func` button, connect the board to the PC via USB, and AXDL will start flashing. Release the button and wait. * Alternatively, connect USB first, then hold `boot/Func` and power on. Once detected by AXDL, release the button. * Do not touch the USB cable or board during flashing. * After completion, the board reboots into the system. The **first boot** may take longer—wait until it reaches the main interface before powering off. ### Method 2 (Recommended): Flashing `.img` System via USB to EMMC This method is faster and easier than flashing `.axp` files. It works on any OS and achieves higher speeds (\\~40MiB/s). #### Choosing the Right Flashing Software We’ll use [Etcher](https://etcher.balena.io/) as an example. Other software works similarly. On Windows, you can also use [Win32DiskImager](https://sourceforge.net/projects/win32diskimager/), [Rufus](https://rufus.ie/), or [imageUSB](https://www.osforensics.com/tools/write usb images.html). If Etcher fails, try one of these alternatives. If you encounter errors like `Error spawning the child process`, it’s likely a permissions issue. Run as administrator. If problems persist, or the system won’t boot after flashing, try `rufus` or `win32diskimager`. #### Load and Flash the System File > `Etcher`may occurs `Missing partition table` `not a bootable image ...` warning, it's normall for `MaixCAM2`, just click `Continue` to continue. * Load the system image you downloaded and extract it. Make sure you’re loading the right one. It’s usually named `maixcam2 2025 09 01 maixpy v4.11.9.img`. * Enter USB/TF upgrade mode: * Method 1: Plug one end of USB into the PC, then within `1 second` of connecting to the board, press and hold `boot/Func`. Release after `3 seconds`. * Method 2: Power off, connect USB, power on, then within `1 second` press and hold `boot/Func`. Release after `3 seconds`. > Don’t hold the button before power on—this enters AXDL mode, which takes at least 10 seconds. Too slow. * After a few seconds, you’ll see a virtual U disk appear. The blue LED flashes in a `off on on` pattern. * Click the software’s “Flash” button to begin. The blue LED flashes `0.5s on / 0.5s off`. * If Windows prompts to format the new drive—**do not format it**! Just close the window. * When done, the blue LED becomes solid on. Software may still be verifying data—wait for it. * Safely eject the drive. * Reboot to enter the new system. Again, wait for the first boot to reach the main interface before powering off. ### Method 3: Flashing `.img` System via TF Card to EMMC This is similar to USB flashing but often faster (depending on TF card speed, e.g. \\~90MiB/s). #### Preparing a TF Upgrade Card * Insert the TF card into your PC using a card reader. * Format the TF card as `exFAT` or `ext4` (not `FAT32`). Make sure to partition the TF card. * Copy the xxx.img file to the first partition of the TF card. If you have previously copied other `.img` files, you need to delete the old image files. * Safely eject the card to ensure data is fully written. * Power off the MaixCAM2, then insert the TF card into the MaixCAM2. * Power on the MaixCAM2, and within `1 second`, press and hold the `boot/Func` button. * The board will auto detect and flash the system. Blue LED flashes `0.5s on / 0.5s off`. > If it doesn’t, check previous steps. * When complete, the LED stays solid on. Fast flashing (`0.3s on / 0.3s off`) indicates failure. Do not power off—use Method 2 (USB) to recover. If powered off and still failing, use AXDL to restore the boot partition. * Reboot to enter the new system. As before, wait for the first boot to finish before shutting down. ## Booting System via TF Card If you don't want to use the `EMMC`, you can boot the system via a `TF card`. You need to download the `xxx_sd.img` format image. ### Prepare Flashing Tools Download [Etcher](https://etcher.balena.io/) (highly recommended), install, and open it. Windows can also use [Win32DiskImager](https://sourceforge.net/projects/win32diskimager/) or [Rufus](https://rufus.ie/). If Etcher fails, try these two. ### Flash Image to TF Card Flash the image to the TF card using a card reader. Prepare a `TF card` of 32GB or larger. Insert it into a card reader, then connect to the computer. Open `Etcher`, select the `xxx_sd.img` format image file, select the `TF card`, and click Flash. Wait for the flashing to complete. If the computer pops up a message like `You need to format the disk in drive G: before you can use it`, **do NOT click Format Disk**! Otherwise, the freshly flashed system will be formatted again! Close the window, right click the disk, and select Eject `TF Card`. Insert the TF card into the MaixCAM2, then power on and wait for the system to boot. The first boot may be slower, wait a moment. Note: > For MaixCAM2 with `EMMC`, you need to hold the `Func` button while powering on to load the image from the `TF card`. ## Power Supply Notes ### Shutdown and Power Off Aside from the above flashing situations, do **not** power off by cutting power (including using the power switch, which is also a hard cut). If the system is writing to the TF card, forced power off can corrupt data. The same risk applies when pressing `reset`. Always **shutdown via software first**. Ways to safely shutdown/reboot: * Method 1: From the main interface, long press `Func` to select shutdown, or go to `Settings > Power`. * Method 2: In terminal, run `poweroff` or `reboot`. * Method 3: From code, e.g. in Python: `import os; os.system(\"poweroff\")`. ### File Writing and Data Loss The system uses caching. When writing files, data may remain in memory before being flushed to disk. If power is cut in this period, data is lost. Solutions: * Avoid forced shutdowns/resets; use software shutdown. * To ensure data is written, manually flush caches. For example, in Python: ```python import os os.sync() ``` This tells the system to immediately write cached data to disk. Other languages/contexts have equivalent APIs (search for “Linux flush cache to disk”)."},"/hardware/en/maixcam/cameras.html":{"title":"Sensor Introduction","content":" title: Sensor Introduction ## Camera Module Parameter Comparison **Sensor Model** GC4653 OS04A10 SC035HGS **Resolution** 2560x1440 2688x1520 640x480 **Size** 1/3\" **1/1.79\"** 1/6\" **Pixel Size** 2.0um 2.9um 3.744um **Shutter Type** Rolling Shutter Rolling Shutter **Global Shutter** **Frame Rate** 30fps@2K, 60fps@720P 30fps@2 K 180fps@VGA **Max Exposure** 0.5s 45s TBD **Sensitivity** 2.4V/Lux.s 32000e/Lux.s 6.5V/Lux.s **Dynamic Range** 81dB 120dB 60dB **Lens Focal** 3.05mm 4.9mm **Lens Aperture** F2.5 F1.65 **Lens distortion** 5% 25% **FOV** D90° H81° V51° D100° H87° V49° > Note: The OS04A10 sensor has large pixels and the lens has a large aperture, providing excellent night vision performance.

It has made a significant leap in performance, making it more suitable for remote working scenarios. To meet different user needs, NanoKVM Pro offers two forms: NanoKVM Desk and NanoKVM ATX: ![](./../../../assets/NanoKVM/pro/introduce/combine.png) NanoKVM Desk is the desktop version of NanoKVM Pro, featuring an anodized matte metal shell. The front panel has a 1.47 inch touchscreen that displays core KVM information and allows for easy hardware function settings or can be used as a mini secondary screen, providing a more tactile user experience with the left side infinite knob. NanoKVM ATX is the internal version of NanoKVM Pro, equipped with half height/full height brackets for installation inside a case. It allows for easier installation for host users with built in USB cables and power control interfaces. Remote control can be achieved via external HDMI, network, and USB connections. NanoKVM Pro uses the AX630 as its main control core, featuring an ARM 1.2G dual core A53 CPU. The external 1GB LPDDR4 memory provides strong computing support for remote desktop connections. It has built in HDMI loop out and capture chips, offering up to 4K60FPS HDMI loop out and 4K45FPS video capture. Thanks to AX630's efficient and powerful image processing architecture, NanoKVM Pro can transmit high resolution images with very low latency, with typical delays as low as 60ms at 2K resolution. The IP KVM series products are hardware add ons for remote desktops, capturing images via HDMI, synchronizing images and keyboard/mouse operations in real time over the network, and simulating keyboard/mouse control of the computer. Since this entire process does not require host software and is completely implemented by external hardware, NanoKVM can achieve BIOS level control of the host, making it widely applicable in scenarios such as remote power on/off, multi system switching, BIOS configuration, and remote installation. Due to its upgraded powerful performance, NanoKVM Pro not only provides reliable support for temporary maintenance but also excels in the remote working field due to its low latency and high resolution characteristics.

It offers optional wifi and POE configurations. Beyond its powerful remote control capabilities, it includes a 1.47 inch touch display and a rotary knob. Its form factor as a desktop accessory offers limitless possibilities for DIY imagination. In version `1.2.1`, we introduced the **APP Hub** feature. Through this feature, you can conveniently download all applications from the [Open Source Application Repository](https://github.com/sipeed/NanoKVM UserApps). If you have great ideas, you are also welcome to build your own applications based on the documentation below and submit them to the open source repository. We will conduct a basic functionality review on submitted applications. Once approved, the applications you develop will be available for download and use by all NanoKVM Desk users! ## How to Build Your Own Application > You can send this document to an AI to assist in generating your own application! ### Project Folder Introduction The NanoKVM Desk UserAPP scans all folders under the `/userapp` directory; each folder represents an APP, and the folder name is the APP name. Each folder must contain at least `main.py` and `app.toml`. `main.py` is the code that runs, and `app.toml` is the configuration file with the following content: ```toml [application] name \"XXX\" # Use the folder name, displayed on startup (must match the directory name) version \"1.0.0\" # Used for version upgrades, displayed on startup (must be a subset of SemVer format MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH) descriptions \"Example\" # Used as a brief description of the App, displayed during download/update (required, helps users quickly understand the app's functionality) [author] name \"Sipeed xxx\" # Fill in the author's name, displayed on startup (required) email \"xxx@sipeed.com\" # Allows users to contact the author easily (optional) [interaction] requires_user_input false # Whether touchscreen and rotary knob events need to be enabled; if true, the program must have an active exit mechanism (optional) ``` ### Screen Basic Information and Usage The NanoKVM Desk screen resolution is 320*172, accessed via `/dev/fb0`. The device is equipped with a 172x320 pixel RGB565 color display, accessible via the framebuffer device `/dev/fb0`. Applications can draw directly to this display device. #### Display Characteristics **Resolution**: 172x320 pixels (but the logical screen is 320x172 see rotation note below) **Color Depth**: 16 bit RGB565 format (Red 5 bits, Green 6 bits, Blue 5 bits) **Framebuffer Device**: `/dev/fb0` **Display Orientation**: The physical display is in portrait mode, but applications typically create a landscape image (320x172) which is rotated 90 degrees counter clockwise for display. #### Basic Display Usage Using the display device in Python applications: 1. **Set constants for the physical display dimensions**: ```python PHYSICAL_WIDTH 172 PHYSICAL_HEIGHT 320 BPP 16 # Bits per pixel ``` 2. **Create a display class interfacing with the framebuffer**: ```python import mmap import os import numpy as np from PIL import Image, ImageDraw class RGB565Display: def __init__(self, fb_device \"/dev/fb0\"): self.physical_width PHYSICAL_WIDTH self.physical_height PHYSICAL_HEIGHT self.bpp BPP self.fb_size self.physical_width * self.physical_height * (self.bpp // 8) # Open the framebuffer device self.fb_fd os.open(fb_device, os.O_RDWR) self.fb_mmap mmap.mmap( self.fb_fd, self.fb_size, mmap.MAP_SHARED, mmap.PROT_WRITE ) self.fb_array np.frombuffer(self.fb_mmap, dtype np.uint16).reshape( (self.physical_height, self.physical_width) ) def rgb_to_rgb565(self, r, g, b): \"\"\"Convert 8 bit RGB to RGB565 format\"\"\" return ((r & 0xF8) << 8) ((g & 0xFC) << 3) (b >> 3) def clear_screen(self, color 0x0000): \"\"\"Clear the screen with the specified color\"\"\" self.fb_array.fill(color) def _display_image(self, logical_img): \"\"\"Rotate the logical image and display it on the physical screen\"\"\" # Rotate the logical image 90 degrees counter clockwise to get the physical image physical_img logical_img.rotate(90, expand True) # Convert to RGB565 and copy to the framebuffer rgb_array np.array(physical_img) r (rgb_array[:, :, 0] >> 3).astype(np.uint16) g (rgb_array[:, :, 1] >> 2).astype(np.uint16) b (rgb_array[:, :, 2] >> 3).astype(np.uint16) rgb565 (r << 11) (g << 5) b # Copy the entire array directly to the framebuffer self.fb_array[:, :] rgb565 def close(self): \"\"\"Close resources\"\"\" self.fb_mmap.close() os.close(self.fb_fd) ``` 3. **Draw content on the display**: ```python def main(): display RGB565Display() try: # Create a logical landscape image (320x172) logical_img Image.new(\"RGB\", (320, 172), (0, 0, 0)) draw ImageDraw.Draw(logical_img) # Draw content (e.g., rectangle, text) draw.rectangle([10, 10, 100, 100], fill (255, 0, 0)) # Red rectangle # Display the image display._display_image(logical_img) # Wait for some time import time time.sleep(5) finally: display.close() if __name__ \"__main__\": main() ``` #### Best Practices for Display Usage Always rotate your logical landscape image (320x172) counter clockwise to match the physical portrait display (172x320) Use efficient drawing methods whenever possible to reduce rendering time Properly close resources in a `finally` block or context manager to prevent resource leaks Consider performance when drawing frequently updated content (e.g., animations) ### Input Event Basics and Usage The NanoKVM Desk has three types of input events: knob rotation, knob press, and touch. > If you want to use input events, you must declare `requires_user_input true` in `app.toml`, and your program must have a clear, active exit mechanism; otherwise, it cannot exit back to NanoKVM UI. > If your program does not require touch or knob input events, set the configuration field `requires_user_input false` or omit it. NanoKVM UI will then exit the program when the screen is touched or the button is pressed. #### Input Device Locations **Knob Rotation Event**: `/dev/input/event0` ```shell root@kvm 72d6:~# evtest /dev/input/event0 Input driver version is 1.0.1 Input device ID: bus 0x19 vendor 0x0 product 0x0 version 0x0 Input device name: \"rotary@0\" Supported events: Event type 0 (EV_SYN) Event type 2 (EV_REL) Event code 0 (REL_X) Properties: Testing ...

For an overview of the Computer Use concept, refer to Anthropic’s demonstration video and user experiences shared on Reddit: https://www.reddit.com/r/ClaudeAI/comments/1ga3uqn/mindblowing_experience_with_claude_computer_use <iframe width \"560\" height \"315\" src \"https://www.youtube.com/embed/ODaHJzOyVCQ\" frameborder \"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> ## Advantages of NanoKVM Pro How does NanoKVM Pro’s implementation of Computer Use compare favorably to Anthropic’s offering? 1. **Out of the box usability** NanoKVM Pro comes with the Computer Use application built in. Users can launch it directly from the web UI with a single click—no complex environment setup required, unlike Anthropic’s demo which demands significant pre configuration. 2. **Hardware level Computer Use** Anthropic’s solution is software based, limiting support to macOS 11+ and Windows 10+. Linux and Android are not supported. NanoKVM Pro’s Computer Use operates at the hardware level. As an IP KVM device, it natively captures screenshots and controls mouse/keyboard at the hardware layer, enabling compatibility with Windows, macOS, Linux, and even Android. 3. **Support for self hosted deployment** Anthropic uses a closed source large model, requiring users to upload screenshots to their servers—making it unsuitable for privacy sensitive tasks. NanoKVM Pro supports custom VLM model endpoints. You can connect to either online commercial APIs or your own self hosted open source VLM server (via OpenAI compatible API). Until recently (mid 2025), no open source VLM could perform basic Computer Use tasks. However, Alibaba’s newly released open source models—**qwen3 vl 235b a22b instruct** and **qwen3 vl 30b a3b instruct** (October 2025)—now enable foundational Computer Use capabilities. With the rapid advancement of AI models, we believe that by next year, open source VLMs will deliver practical, self hosted Computer Use functionality. Below are mobile screen recordings of NanoKVM Pro performing simple demonstration tasks (downloading an ESP32 datasheet and setting DNS): <div class \"video row\"> <video playsinline controls muted preload src \"../../../assets/NanoKVM/pro/cua/download_esp32.mp4\"></video> <video playsinline controls muted preload src \"../../../assets/NanoKVM/pro/cua/set_dns.mp4\"></video> </div> <style> .video row { display: flex; gap: 12px; flex wrap: wrap; justify content: center; } .video row video { flex: 1; min width: 280px; aspect ratio: 9/16; } @media (max width: 600px) { .video row { flex direction: column; } } </style> As an experimental feature, NanoKVM Pro’s Computer Use Agent (CUA) is implemented as a standalone Python service, making it easy for community developers to modify and test. Contributions from developers interested in AI Agents are welcome: https://github.com/sipeed/nanokvm_cua ## Critical Warnings Before Use!!! Before explaining how to try this feature, we must **emphatically stress** the current limitations and risks of CUA. Today’s large models are still very limited and prone to **hallucinations**. When granted hardware level control, these hallucinations can cause **irreversible damage** to your computer. For example, in 2025, a user reportedly lost an entire database due to unintended actions by Anthropic’s Computer Use feature. **While using CUA, please stay physically near your computer**, monitor every action the AI performs, and be ready to interrupt it immediately if it attempts a dangerous operation. Additionally, CUA requires connection to a VLM model server. You must either: Purchase token credits from a VLM provider and enter your API key, **or** Deploy your own VLM server. **Users are solely responsible for any data loss, system damage, or incurred costs resulting from the use of CUA.** ## Quick Start Guide ### Set Video Mode CUA captures screenshots from the KVM stream. Before using CUA, switch the **Video Mode** to **MJPEG**, and we recommend setting your desktop resolution to **1280×720**: 1. Higher resolution images increase VLM inference time and token costs. 2. Lower resolutions (e.g., 800×600) make on screen elements too small, forcing CUA to take more steps—increasing cost and failure rate. ![set_mjpeg](../../../assets/NanoKVM/pro/cua/set_mjpeg.jpg) ### Read the Safety Notice Click the **\"Smart Assistant\"** icon in the floating toolbar to view CUA’s safety notice. We **strongly urge** you to fully read and understand all risks before proceeding. ![note](../../../assets/NanoKVM/pro/cua/note.jpg) ### Install Dependencies Since CUA is experimental and involves privacy sensitive operations, we do **not** pre install its dependencies. On first use, click the **\"Install Dependencies\"** button to automatically install required packages. A terminal window will appear showing installation progress—please wait until it completes. ### Launch CUA Service After dependencies are installed, click **\"Try It Now\"** to start the CUA service. A new CUA window will appear within 5–10 seconds. *(If no window appears, check if your browser blocked pop ups.)* > Note: The current CUA implementation increases CPU usage on the KVM host, which may cause lag in the main KVM interface. For security reasons: Only **one CUA instance** is allowed at a time. Opening the CUA URL in a new tab will **not** work. Closing or refreshing the CUA webpage **automatically stops** the service. You must restart it from the main page. The CUA web interface is responsive and works on both desktop and mobile browsers. Desktop layout example: ![web_pc](../../../assets/NanoKVM/pro/cua/web_pc.jpg) > **For developers**: You can manually run CUA via terminal: > `python /kvmapp/cua/cua_webapp.py auth` ### Configure CUA Settings On first use, go to the **Settings** tab and fill in the following: 1. **API Type** **DashScope** (default): Lightweight, see https://www.aliyun.com/product/bailian **OpenAI**: Most universal format—ideal for self hosted VLM servers (e.g., vLLM/SGLang) **Genai**: *TODO* 2. **API Key** Enter the key from your VLM provider or your self hosted server. 3. **Base URL** Required for OpenAI style APIs. Examples: `https://dashscope.aliyuncs.com/compatible mode/v1` `https://192.168.0.xxx:8000/v1` 4. **Model Name** Specify the VLM model name: Commercial: `qwen3 vl plus` Open source: `qwen3 vl 235b a22b instruct`, `qwen3 vl 30b a3b instruct` For self hosted vLLM deployments: use the ` served model name` you configured 5. **IMG_KEEP_N** To reduce token usage, only the most recent *N* screenshots are retained. 6. **MAX_ROUNDS** Maximum steps per task—to prevent infinite loops and excessive token consumption. 7. **Initial Prompt** This is the system prompt we designed for CUA tasks. Minor tuning is allowed, but **do not modify** the instruction generation part unless you also update the corresponding Python script. Click **\"Submit\"** to save your configuration. ### Issue Automation Tasks Switch back to the **Chat** tab, enter your desired task in the text box (e.g., *\"download raspberrypi datasheet\"* or *\"set dns server to 8.8.8.8\"*), and click **\"Send\"** to observe CUA in action. > The right side preview window is **read only**—you cannot interact with it via mouse/keyboard. The chat window displays each step’s screenshot and CUA’s planned action. If CUA gets stuck in a loop, click **\"Pause\"**, provide corrective instructions, then click **\"Send\"**. If CUA is about to perform a dangerous action, **pause immediately**. To start a new task, click **\"Reset\"**. ![chat_task](../../../assets/NanoKVM/pro/cua/chat_task.jpg) ## Self Hosting a VLM Model ### Hardware Requirements Thanks to the Qwen3 VL series release, self hosting a VLM for CUA is now feasible. As of October 2025, the open source **Qwen3 VL** models have significantly improved: `qwen3 vl 235b a22b instruct` surpasses last year’s `qwen vl max` `qwen3 vl 30b a3b instruct` outperforms `qwen2.5 vl 72b instruct` Both now meet the threshold for basic computer control tasks. > It is expected that Qwen3 VL 4B will be released in mid October. It may also feature CUA capabilities, which would make self deployment on regular consumer grade computers possible! However: The **235B** model requires at least **4×H100 GPUs** (320GB total)—impractical for most users. We focus on demonstrating **qwen3 vl 30b a3b instruct** (30B parameters), which needs ~40GB of memory (depending on precision). Possible deployment setups: 1. **1× L40S / RTX6000 / H100** → FP8 2. **2× RTX4090 / RTX5090** → FP8 3. **4× RTX3090** → FP16 4. **CPU**: 48GB+ RAM, 16+ cores → Q4 quantization > Note: Community released [Q4 quantized models](https://huggingface.co/yairpatch/Qwen3 VL 30B A3B Thinking GGUF) appear to suffer from excessive quantization error, leading to inaccurate UI clicks. Official AWQ quantized versions may resolve this. Thus, **4×RTX3090** or **2×RTX4090/5090** are the most practical options for individual users. We’ve successfully tested deployments using **vLLM** (SGLang is also supported)—both provide OpenAI compatible APIs. **2025.10.15 Updated** The Qwen3 VL 8B and 4B models were released today! After testing, the Qwen3 VL 8B Instruct model is also capable of achieving basic CUA functionality! This means the barrier for individual users to self deploy and experience CUA has been lowered to a single RTX 3090 graphics card, or a CPU with 32GB of RAM or more. This is a configuration accessible to most digital enthusiasts. Come and try it out! ### Deploying VLM with vLLM 1. Install vLLM: https://docs.vllm.ai/en/stable/getting_started/installation/gpu.html 2. Download model weights (FP16 or FP8): https://modelscope.cn/models/Qwen/Qwen3 VL 30B A3B Instruct https://modelscope.cn/models/Qwen/Qwen3 VL 30B A3B Instruct FP8 https://modelscope.cn/models/Qwen/Qwen3 VL 8B Instruct 3. Launch the server: 4xGPU run Qwen3 VL 30B A3B Instruct： ```shell vllm serve \\ /your_models_path//Qwen/Qwen3 VL 30B A3B Instruct \\ host 0.0.0.0 \\ port 8000 \\ tensor parallel size 4 \\ gpu memory utilization 0.90 \\ max model len 65536 \\ served model name qwen3 vl 30b a3b instruct \\ api key skxxxxxx ``` 1xGPU Run Qwen3 VL 8B Instruct: ```shell vllm serve \\ /your_models_path//Qwen/Qwen3 VL 8B Instruct \\ host 0.0.0.0 \\ port 8000 \\ tensor parallel size 1 \\ gpu memory utilization 0.90 \\ max model len 32768 \\ served model name qwen3 vl 8b instruct \\ api key skxxxxxx ``` Then configure CUA with your local server details—and enjoy fully private, local Computer Use!

Connect Power > NanoKVM Pro requires a relatively stable power supply. Some motherboard USB ports may not provide sufficient current. > To ensure stable operation, we strongly recommend using an external 5V 1A or higher power adapter (actual power consumption is around 3W). > If you plan to use it with an LED strip, we strongly recommend using an external 5V 3A or higher power adapter. ![desk_con_pwr](../../../assets/NanoKVM/pro/start/desk_con_pwr.jpg) 2. Connect the USB HID interface: ![desk_con_hid](../../../assets/NanoKVM/pro/start/desk_con_hid.jpg) 3. Use an Ethernet cable to connect the router/switch and NanoKVM Pro. If no wired network is available, you may skip this step and configure Wi Fi after startup (Wi Fi version required; see the Wi Fi configuration section). ![desk_con_eth](../../../assets/NanoKVM/pro/start/desk_con_eth.jpg) 4. Connect HDMI IN. If your motherboard has only one video output and you also need an external monitor, connect HDMI OUT to your display. ![desk_con_hdmi_in](../../../assets/NanoKVM/pro/start/desk_con_hdmi_in.jpg) > Note: NanoKVM Pro supports up to 4K30FPS capture. The built in HDMI splitter actively reads the external display's resolution and refresh rate, then provides a common mode list to the host. > If you connect a 4K60 display, the computer will recognize it as a maximum 4K30 display (limited by the capture module). You may disable capture to allow full 4K60 output to the monitor. > If you connect a 1080P display, the computer will recognize it as a maximum 1080P display (limited by the passthrough monitor). 5. (Optional) Connect ATX power control interface ![desk_con_atx](../../../assets/NanoKVM/pro/start/desk_con_atx.jpg) Use a USB C to A data cable to connect the KVM B board with the NanoKVM Desk ATX interface. The KVM B board includes a general 9 pin header, which can be directly attached to the motherboard. The case’s power button, Power LED, and other connectors can be plugged into the KVM B header. Reference diagram (only power button connected here): ![img](../../../assets/NanoKVM/unbox/new ATX B.png) ## UI Operation Guide ### Appearance The Desk version features two interactive components on the front: * 1.47 inch IPS capacitive touch TFT display * Rotary encoder with button ### Rotary Encoder Operations The rotary encoder supports the following actions: * **Rotate Left**: Move focus to the left interactive/focusable component * **Rotate Right**: Move focus to the right interactive/focusable component * **Short Press**: Trigger the action of the focused component * **Long Press**: If on the main page, enter switching mode and display page options ### Touch Operations Touch screen supports the following actions: * **Swipe Left**: Move the overall view to the left * **Swipe Right**: Move the overall view to the right * **Short Tap**: Trigger the action of the tapped component * **Long Press**: If on the main page, enter switching mode and display page options ## LAN Access ### Network Connection 1. **Wired Connection**: After powering on, KVM will automatically obtain an IP address from the router via DHCP. No extra configuration is required. 2. **Wi Fi Connection**: 1. Open `Settings` → `Wi Fi` 2. Short press the `Wi Fi` switch 3. If Wi Fi has not been configured, KVM will start a Wi Fi hotspot (AP) and display AP information on the screen 4. Use a phone or computer to connect to the AP with the displayed password, or scan the QR code for quick connection 5. Once successfully connected, the UI will automatically jump and display a web link 6. Open the link in a browser or scan the QR code to enter the Wi Fi configuration page > **Note**: > You can switch between the AP info page and the web link page by swiping left/right. > Once Wi Fi is successfully connected and the Wi Fi function is not disabled, the device will automatically connect on each startup. 3. **USB NCM Connection**: If needed, you can establish a network connection via USB NCM. ### Network Access 1. After successful connection, the home page will display the device’s IP address. Priority is Ethernet (ETH) first, then Wi Fi. For detailed IP info, go to `Settings` under the corresponding network card. 2. In the same LAN, use a browser on the host (Chrome recommended) and enter the device IP address to access the page. ![ssl](../../../assets/NanoKVM/pro/start/SSL.png) > **Tip**: A security warning on the first visit is normal. NanoKVM Pro enables HTTPS by default with a self signed SSL certificate for enhanced security. 3. Use the default account `admin` and password `admin` to log in. **We strongly recommend changing the account and password immediately after your first login.** 4. Once logged in, check whether image display, keyboard/mouse control, and power buttons function properly. ![4k](../../../assets/NanoKVM/pro/start/nanokvm4K.png) ## Remote Connection 1. **Tailscale**: NanoKVM Pro comes with Tailscale preinstalled. You can log in to your Tailscale account via the web settings. All devices logged into Tailscale will automatically join the same virtual LAN and be assigned an IP starting with `100.xxx.xxx.xxx`. You can use this IP to remotely access and control your host. 2. **Other Remote Networking Tools**: NanoKVM Pro runs on Ubuntu and supports installing third party applications (e.g., ZeroTier) via `apt`. Please follow the official documentation of the respective tool for installation and configuration. ## Rack Mounting The NanoKVM Pro Desk is designed with the possibility of rack mounting, though this requires some hands on modification by the user. There are four screws located under the rubber feet on the bottom of the Desk unit. The two rear screws can be used for structural mounting. (Note: The two front screws are shorter and are located close to internal PCBA components, so they are not recommended for mounting.) We provide the 3D model of the Desk unit and a reference design for the rack adapter plate (single unit and triple unit) You may download and 3D print these, or design your own. [3d_zh](https://makerworld.com.cn/zh/models/1659366 nanokvm pro desk mo xing#profileId 1821374) [3d_en](https://makerworld.com/zh/models/1873387 nanokvm pro desk model#profileId 2005371) Installation Steps 1. Peel off the rear rubber feet and remove the original M2x6 mm screws. (new batch after Oct 2025 is M2x7mm already) 2. Replace them with M2x7 mm screws and fasten the unit to the adapter plate. 3. Secure the adapter plate to the screw holes on the rack rail edge. Diagrams of the installed unit: ![rack1](../../../assets/NanoKVM/pro/start/rack1.jpg) ![rack3](../../../assets/NanoKVM/pro/start/rack3.jpg) ## Heat Dissipation and Working Temperature For long term operational longevity, the NanoKVM Pro Desk utilizes passive cooling. The KVM's main body uses an aluminum alloy casing. The primary heat dissipation path is from the bottom of the PCBA, transferring heat through thermal paste to the bottom of the enclosure, and then dissipating heat through the bottom surface or radiating from the top surface. Therefore, placing the KVM on a highly conductive metal surface (such as a metal case or a rack) or in a well ventilated environment will significantly aid in cooling. Temperature Specifications The KVM's typical working power consumption is 3–4W. The operating temperature rise of the chassis surface is about 15–20°C, and the CPU's temperature rise is around 50°C. For touch scenarios (e.g., desktop use): We recommend an ambient working temperature of under 25°C. This keeps the chassis surface temperature below 45°C. (Note: Since the enclosure is metal, it will feel hotter to the touch than plastic at the same temperature.) For non touch scenarios (e.g., rack mounting): We recommend an ambient working temperature of under 40°C. The figure below shows the surface temperature at an ambient temperature of 26°C ![temp](../../../assets/NanoKVM/pro/start/temperature.jpg)"},"/hardware/en/kvm/NanoKVM_Pro/extended.html":{"title":"Advanced Applications","content":" title: Advanced Applications keywords: NanoKVM, Remote desktop, Lichee, PiKVM, RISCV, tool, PCIe update: date: 2025 8 26 version: v0.1 author: BuGu content: Release docs date: 2025 9 11 version: v0.2 author: iawak9lkm content: Add new feature description ## System Framework Switching In addition to running the NanoKVM framework, NanoKVM Pro is fully compatible with the PiKVM software framework. You can flexibly switch between them based on your usage requirements. ### Switching from NanoKVM to PiKVM NanoKVM Pro ships with the NanoKVM framework by default. Follow these steps to switch: 1. Navigate to `Settings` → `About` → `Switch Device` ![](./../../../assets/NanoKVM/pro/extended/SwitchtoPiKVM.png) 2. After clicking the switch button, the system will automatically restart and boot into the PiKVM framework (takes approximately 30 seconds). If it doesn't switch automatically after a long time, please manually refresh the webpage ![](./../../../assets/NanoKVM/pro/extended/PiKVMLogin.png) 3. The default account and password under the PiKVM framework are also `admin` / `admin` ![](./../../../assets/NanoKVM/pro/extended/PiKVM Setting.png) **Important Notes:** > > The two platforms manage accounts and passwords independently and do not synchronize. It is strongly recommended to change the default password immediately after logging in > Some features under the PiKVM framework need to be implemented through the web terminal, such as WiFi configuration, Tailscale configuration, etc. > When the NanoKVM system updates, the PiKVM framework will also be updated synchronously ### PiKVM Password Management PiKVM currently does not support password modification through the web UI. You need to execute the following commands via SSH or the web terminal: ```shell # Change Linux system user password passwd root # Change KVM login password kvmd htpasswd set admin # User management commands kvmd htpasswd add <user> # Add new user and set password kvmd htpasswd list # Display user list kvmd htpasswd del <user> # Delete user ``` For more usage methods, please refer to [PiKVM Official Documentation Authentication](https://docs.pikvm.org/auth/). ### Configuring WiFi Network PiKVM currently does not support WiFi configuration through the web UI and LCD screen. You can choose one of the following methods: **Method 1: Switch to NanoKVM Framework for Configuration (Recommended)** After switching to the NanoKVM framework, use the web interface or LCD screen to configure WiFi, then switch back to the PiKVM framework **Method 2: Command Line Configuration** Execute the following commands via SSH or web terminal: ```shell # Connect to open network (no password) /kvmcomm/scripts/wifi.sh connect_start <SSID> # Connect to encrypted network (requires password) /kvmcomm/scripts/wifi.sh connect_start <SSID> <PASSWORD> # Disconnect WiFi connection /kvmcomm/scripts/wifi.sh connect_stop ``` ### Configuring Tailscale Network PiKVM currently does not support Tailscale configuration through the web UI. Please use the NanoKVM framework to configure Tailscale, then switch back to the PiKVM framework. ### Switching from PiKVM Back to NanoKVM Switching from the PiKVM system back to NanoKVM is equally simple: 1. Navigate to `Options` → `Switch to NanoKVM` 2. Click the `Switch Now` button ![](./../../../assets/NanoKVM/pro/extended/SwitchtoNanoKVM.png) 3. The system will automatically restart and boot into the NanoKVM framework (takes approximately 30 seconds). If it doesn't switch automatically after a long time, please manually refresh the webpage ### More Features For more features, please refer to the [PiKVM Official Documentation](https://docs.pikvm.org/). ## SSH & mDNS ### SSH By default, NanoKVM Pro disables SSH to ensure system security. If you need to enable the SSH service or use it when previewing new versions, you can turn it on as follows: **ATX/Desk**: From the web interface, go to `Settings` → `Device` → enable `SSH` **Desk**: From the screen, tap `Settings` → `SSH` to enable `SSH` The default account is `root` with the password `sipeed`. If you change the web account password in the NanoKVM interface, the SSH password will be updated accordingly. ### mDNS To enable or disable mDNS, use the following methods: **ATX/Desk**: From the web interface, go to `Settings` → `Device` → enable/disable `mDNS` **Desk**: From the screen, tap `Settings` → `mDNS` to enable/disable `mDNS` ## HDMI Input & Loop Out > Currently, configuration is only supported on the Desk version’s screen. > Support for ATX/Desk web interface will be added soon. If HDMI functionality is not required, you can disable it to reduce power consumption. Operation: On Desk: From the screen, tap `Settings` → `HDMI` to enter the HDMI configuration page, which has two options: **INPUT**: When disabled, Desk stops capturing HDMI input signals. **LOOP OUT**: When disabled, Desk stops outputting HDMI loop out signals. ## Display Adjustment ### ATX Currently, the OLED screen supports the following function: Short press the `USR` button to toggle the OLED display on or off. ### Desk The LCD screen supports the following functions (all configured from the screen): Adjust backlight brightness: `Settings` → `Brightness` Standby clock: `Settings` → `Auto Clock` When disabled, the LCD remains always on. When enabled, the LCD switches to a clock display after a long period of inactivity. ## Factory Reset ### Quick Reset **ATX**: Long press the `USR` button until the screen shows `Reset`, then release. > Requires version ≥ `1.0.13` **Desk**: From the screen, tap `Settings` → `Help` to enter the Help page. Repeatedly tap the reset button until `0` appears, and the device enters recovery mode. > **Note**: Do not perform any other operations until the device has fully restarted and refreshed the screen. ### Deep Reset For details, see the [FAQ](https://wiki.sipeed.com/hardware/en/kvm/NanoKVM_Pro/faq.html#Image Burning Methods) section on `Image Burning Methods`. ## HDMI Secondary Display Since NanoKVM Pro can emulate a display, capture screen content, and features a small built in screen, it can function as an HDMI secondary display. In the UI, simply select **HDMI** as the video output source to display the captured video feed on the small screen. When used as a desktop accessory, this feature can serve as a: Mini secondary monitor System performance monitor Video thumbnail player and more. ![](./../../../assets/NanoKVM/pro/extended/hdmi.jpg) <video playsinline controls muted preload src \"../../../assets/NanoKVM/pro/extended/cat.mp4\"></video> <video playsinline controls muted preload src \"../../../assets/NanoKVM/pro/extended/video.mp4\"></video> ## USB Expansion Features ### USB NCM The NCM function allows the NanoKVM to simulate a USB network card, enabling users to log in directly via USB. To enable: **ATX/Desk**: From the web interface, go to `Settings` → `Device` → enable `Virtual Network` **Desk**: From the screen, tap `Settings` → `USB` → enable `NCM` ### USB Secondary Display > **Supported only on NanoKVM Desk** > Currently, the USB secondary display function is supported only on Windows systems. 1. Download and extract the USB secondary display driver. 2. On Desk: From the screen, tap `Settings` → `USB` to enter the USB configuration page, then enable `Panel`. 3. On the controlled PC: Open `Device Manager` → `Other devices` Find `NanoKVMPro` → right click `Properties` → `Driver` → `Update driver` Choose `Browse my computer for drivers` → `Let me pick from a list of available drivers on my computer` Double click `Show all devices` Under `Standard USB Host Controller` / `Standard system devices`, locate `USB Composite Device` → double click to install > **Note**: Driver locations may vary depending on Windows version. Please search carefully. 4. After installation, a new `loop input to output` device will appear under `Other devices` in Device Manager. 5. Right click this device → `Update driver` → `Browse my computer for drivers` → `Browse` → select the USB secondary display driver folder → `Next` → follow the prompts to complete installation. 6. Once installed, a new NanoKVM graphics device will appear under `Display adapters`. 7. On Desk, enter the secondary display page from the screen, select USB, and the Desk will function as a USB secondary display. 8. To disable, refer to step 2 to turn off `Panel`. 9. When re enabling, some systems may require reinstalling the USB driver. ## Updates NanoKVM Pro will periodically push new application versions that include new features and bug fixes. You can update the application version in `Settings` > `Check for Updates`. ![](./../../../assets/NanoKVM/pro/extended/Update.png) After clicking download, the new application installation package will be automatically downloaded, which includes `kvmcomm_x.x.x_arm64.deb`, `nanokvmpro_x.x.x_arm64.deb`, and `pikvm_x.x.x_arm64.deb`: `kvmcomm_x.x.x_arm64.deb` is responsible for driving the shared hardware in the NanoKVM and PiKVM frameworks; `nanokvmpro_x.x.x_arm64.deb` is the NanoKVM application software; `pikvm_x.x.x_arm64.deb` is the PiKVM application software. Enabling the preview update feature will allow you to access the latest experimental application, which usually includes updated features but may lack stability. It is recommended to enable SSH before downloading preview updates. You can also download specific versions and install them manually. ```shell # Taking download of version 1.1.6 as an example # Download file sudo curl L https://cdn.sipeed.com/nanokvm/preview/nanokvm_pro_1.1.6.tar.gz sudo tar xz # Enter folder cd nanokvm_pro_1.1.6 # Install deb packages sudo apt install ./*.deb ``` > Software version 1.1.5 and later underwent an architectural adjustment. Older NanoKVM Pro units can only fetch up to version 1.1.5 initially; after updating, they will be able to retrieve the latest versions. ## How to Use TF Card for Storage Expansion The NanoKVM Desk version features a TF card slot on the rear panel. Inserting a TF card expands the storage capacity and enables the `Virtual U Disk` function. The TF card is mounted by default under the NanoKVM system's `/sdcard` directory. When `Virtual U Disk` is enabled, the TF card is simultaneously mounted as a mass storage device through the USB composite interface, allowing file transfer to the controlled host via this feature. > Note: > The ATX version cannot expose the TF card slot due to bracket size constraints. > The first batch of Desk versions does not support TF card hot plugging. Please insert the TF card when the device is powered off. > The Virtual U Disk and image mounting functions cannot be enabled simultaneously. ## How to Perform Remote OS Installation In addition to simulating keyboard and mouse devices, the USB C port of NanoKVM Pro also emulates a USB drive device. This can be used to mount specified ISO files for tasks like OS installation. ISO files can be uploaded to the NanoKVM Pro, which offers approximately 21GB of available space. Unlike a regular USB drive, NanoKVM's virtual USB drive can store multiple ISO files simultaneously. Before powering on the target host, you can select which system ISO to mount via the options on the web interface. After connecting the remote host and Nano KVM as described in the previous steps, log into the system via your browser. Click the CD ROM icon and select the target system ISO to mount it. ![](./../../../assets/NanoKVM/guide/imgsl.png) Next, begin the OS installation process. Click `Power On (Short Press)`, then quickly press the F11 key (the key may vary for different hosts; please refer to your host's manual). Select the corresponding bootable ISO to start and complete the installation. ![](./../../../assets/NanoKVM/guide/install.png) Note: All uploaded ISO files are stored in the `/data` directory of the NanoKVM Pro. Users can directly read and write this partition from within the NanoKVM terminal. If you encounter issues mounting the ISO, try ejecting the ISO from the host first, then click to mount it again. ## How to Set a Static IP NanoKVM Pro introduced static IP configuration for Ethernet cards in version `1.1.6` and above. You can assign a static IP by configuring the `/boot/eth.nodhcp` file. The detailed setup method is as follows: Create a file named `/boot/eth.nodhcp` in NanoKVM Pro, then edit it according to the following rules: Each line represents a custom IP in the format: `addr/netid gw[optional]`; Multiple static IPs can be preset across multiple lines. Simplified steps: ```shell # Perform the following operations in the NanoKVM Pro web terminal or SSH terminal # Create the /boot/eth.nodhcp file and write the configuration echo \"192.168.2.2/22\" > /boot/eth.nodhcp ``` > During system startup, the static IP address list in the `/boot/eth.nodhcp` file will be read. The setup process is as follows: > > 1. **Sequential detection**: The system reads the IPs in the file line by line and checks whether each one is already in use by another device on the network. > 2. **Detection mechanism**: `arping` is used for detection first; if `arping` is not installed in the system, it automatically falls back to using the `ping` command. > 3. **Set available IP**: Once the first available (unused) IP is found, the system immediately sets it as the static address for the device, and the process terminates. > 4. **Fallback option**: If all IPs in the list are occupied, the system will attempt to obtain an IP automatically via DHCP. > 5. **Guaranteed address**: If DHCP also fails to assign an address (for example, if there is no DHCP server on the network), the system will use the fixed guaranteed address `192.168.90.1`. ## How to Use Serial Port NanoKVM Pro provides two sets of available serial ports: UART1/UART2. (Note: The ATX version, limited by the standard bracket size, does not have these ports externally exposed; only the internal solder pads are retained.) The interface definition diagram for the Desk version is as follows: ![](./../../../assets/NanoKVM/pro/extended/UART.png) Using the Serial Terminal via the Web Interface **Requires firmware version 1.1.5 or higher** Navigate to: Web Menu Bar > Terminal > Serial Terminal. Here, you can configure the serial port number, baud rate, and other options. ![](./../../../assets/NanoKVM/pro/extended/UART 2.png) Send serial commands only: ```shell # Set ttyS1 to 115200 baud rate stty F /dev/ttyS1 115200 # Send hexadecimal data 0x11, 0x22, 0x33 echo n e '\\x11\\x22\\x33' > /dev/ttyS1 ``` ## How to Modify EDID EDID (Extended Display Identification Data) is a set of data provided by a display device to the host, including device information, resolution and frame rate lists, color characteristics, audio capabilities, etc. The host adjusts the display settings based on the received EDID. NanoKVM Pro supports modifying the EDID exposed by the virtual display. You can clone the EDID from a monitor or write your own EDID to achieve specific screen ratios, refresh rates, or color characteristics. > Modifying the EDID may risk improper display functionality. Please proceed with caution. If issues arise, restore the default EDID. Writing method: ```shell # 1. Prepare the EDID file, typically 256 bytes, and scp it to the system ls l /root/customize.bin # rw r r 1 1000 1000 256 Aug 19 14:44 /root/customize.bin # 2. Write the EDID cat /root/customize.bin > /proc/lt6911_info/edid # 3. Restore the default EDID: cat /kvmcomm/edid/e18.bin > /proc/lt6911_info/edid ``` Version 1.2.0 comes with six built in EDIDs. Below is the list of supported resolutions and their maximum frame rates for each EDID: Resolution Aspect Ratio 3840×2160@30Hz 3840×2160@39Hz 2560×1440@60Hz 1920×1080@60Hz 3840×2400@30Hz 3440×1440@60Hz 3840×2400 16:10 × × × × 30 FPS × 3840×2160 16:9 30 FPS 39 FPS × × 30 FPS 30 FPS 3840×1600 21:9 × × × × × 50 FPS 3440×1440 21:9 × × × × × 60 FPS 2560×1440 16:9 83 FPS 83 FPS 83 FPS × 60 FPS 60 FPS 2560×1080 21:9 × × × × × 75 FPS 1920×1200 16:10 60 FPS 60 FPS 60 FPS × 60 FPS × 1920×1080 16:9 120 FPS 125 FPS 60 FPS 60 FPS 60 FPS 60 FPS 1680×1050 16:10 60 FPS 60 FPS 60 FPS 60 FPS 60 FPS 60 FPS 1440×900 16:10 60 FPS 60 FPS 60 FPS 60 FPS 60 FPS 60 FPS 1280×1024 5:4 60 FPS 60 FPS 60 FPS 60 FPS 60 FPS 60 FPS 1280×960 4:3 60 FPS 60 FPS 60 FPS 60 FPS 60 FPS 60 FPS 1280×800 16:10 60 FPS 60 FPS 60 FPS 60 FPS 60 FPS 60 FPS 1280×720 16:9 120 FPS 120 FPS 60 FPS 60 FPS 60 FPS 60 FPS 1152×864 4:3 60 FPS 60 FPS 60 FPS 60 FPS 60 FPS 60 FPS 1024×768 4:3 60 FPS 60 FPS 60 FPS 60 FPS 60 FPS 60 FPS 800×600 4:3 120 FPS 120 FPS 60 FPS 60 FPS 60 FPS 60 FPS > Resolutions not listed in this table may experience display errors or fail to display. > Lower resolutions might have compatibility issues, resulting in no display or screen flickering. ## How to Retrieve Display EDID Windows Follow the steps below to export EDID data from the Windows registry. 1. Press **Win + R** to open the *Run* dialog, type `regedit`, and press **Enter**. 2. In the Registry Editor, navigate to: ``` HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\SYSTEM\\CurrentControlSet\\Enum\\DISPLAY ``` 3. Locate the EDID entry for your monitor. The typical path format is: ``` <VendorID>_<Model>\\<InstanceID>\\Device Parameters\\EDID ``` Take note of the full path, especially `<VendorID>_<Model>` and `<InstanceID>`. 4. Create a new file named `edid.ps1` and paste the following content: ```powershell $regPath \"HKLM:\\SYSTEM\\CurrentControlSet\\Enum\\DISPLAY\\<ID>\\<InstanceID>\\Device Parameters\" $edid (Get ItemProperty Path $regPath Name EDID).EDID [IO.File]::WriteAllBytes(\"C:\\Users\\Public\\edid.bin\", $edid) Write Host \"EDID exported to C:\\Users\\Public\\edid.bin\" ``` 5. Replace `<ID>` and `<InstanceID>` with the actual values for your display. 6. Save the file, then right click it and select **Run with PowerShell**. If execution is blocked: Open PowerShell **as Administrator**. Run the following command and confirm: ```powershell Set ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned ``` 7. After successful execution, the EDID binary file will be available at: ``` C:\\Users\\Public\\edid.bin ``` Linux On Linux systems using DRM (Direct Rendering Manager), EDID can be read directly from sysfs. ```bash # Replace <card> with the actual DRM card name, such as card0 or card1 sudo cat /sys/class/drm/<card>/edid > ~/edid.bin ``` If the file exists and the command completes successfully, `edid.bin` will be created in your home directory. macOS On macOS, EDID data can be retrieved from the I/O Registry. 1. Open **Terminal** and run: ```sh ioreg lw0 grep i EDID ``` 2. Look for a line similar to: ```sh \"EDID\" <00ffffffffffff00...> ``` The hexadecimal string inside `< >` represents the EDID data. 3. **Copy the full hexadecimal string** inside the angle brackets (do not include the brackets themselves). Assume the copied string is `xxx`. 4. Convert the hexadecimal EDID string to a binary file: ```sh echo \"xxx\" xxd r p > ~/edid.bin ``` 5. If the command succeeds, `edid.bin` will be created in your home directory. PowerShell Failure Cases and Troubleshooting If exporting EDID on Windows fails, check the following common issues: 1. **Insufficient permissions** Ensure PowerShell is running with administrator privileges. 2. **Script execution policy restrictions** Check the current policy with: ```powershell Get ExecutionPolicy ``` If needed, temporarily allow local scripts: ```powershell Set ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned ``` 3. **Incorrect registry path** Verify that the subkeys under `DISPLAY` and the instance ID exactly match the path used in `$regPath`. 4. **Missing EDID property** Some displays, virtual displays, or remote desktop sessions may not expose EDID. Perform the operation on a physical display connected locally. 5. **File write failure** Ensure `C:\\Users\\Public\\` is writable, or modify the script to use another writable directory. ## How to Modify USB Information Versions `1.2.0` and above support customizing USB information. The method is as follows: ```shell # Modify PID echo \"0xXXXX\" > /boot/usb.pid # Modify VID echo \"0xXXXX\" > /boot/usb.vid # Modify Manufacturer echo \"XXXX\" > /boot/usb.manufacturer # Modify Product Name echo \"XXXX\" > /boot/usb.product # Apply changes /kvmapp/scripts/usbdev.sh restart ``` ## How to Share Network via USB Network Adapter Version `1.2.11` and above supports network sharing through USB network adapter, allowing the controlled host to access the network where NanoKVM Pro is located via USB connection. ```bash # Enable USB network adapter (choose one: NCM mode or RNDIS mode) touch /boot/usb.ncm # touch /boot/usb.rndis # Set network adapter IP address # (optional, defaults to a fixed IP generated using device ID) echo \"10.10.10.1/24\" > /boot/ncm.ipv4 # Set DNS server address (optional, defaults to 8.8.8.8, 8.8.4.4) echo \"8.8.8.8 8.8.4.4\" > /boot/ncm.dns # Set traffic forwarding interface # (eth0 for wired network, wlan0 for wireless network) echo \"eth0\" > /boot/ncm.forward # Restart USB network adapter to apply changes /kvmapp/scripts/usbdev.sh restart ``` ## How to Use with the Host Application The NanoKVM Pro host application needs to be installed and run on the controlled PC. It provides additional functionality and a smoother user experience. It is recommended to install the precompiled Release version directly. The host application is still under development, and the source code will be open sourced later for manual compilation. [Download Link](https://github.com/sipeed/NanoKVM Pro/releases/tag/v1.0.5) After installation, launch the application and enter the local network IP address of the NanoKVM Pro you want to pair with. The application runs in the background and can be closed via a right click on the system tray icon. Key Features Automatically hide the controlled PC cursor for better remote control experience When the host application is connected to NanoKVM Pro, the cursor on the controlled PC is hidden. After the host application disconnects from NanoKVM Pro for a while, the cursor will reappear. Collect CPU and memory usage of the controlled PC and transmit it to NanoKVM Pro In the Desk version, you can view the controlled PC status in real time via the Host Info page. ## About Latency NanoKVM Pro has made significant improvements in latency, with end to end latency controlled at around 100ms at any resolution. > The latency mentioned by other competitors is not end to end latency, but one way latency. The actual end to end latency is much higher than what they claim. > Actual tests show that choosing different frame rates has little impact on end to end latency, meaning the latency for 1080P120 and 1080P30 is almost the same. Video Mode End to End Latency Direct H264 100ms WebRTC H264 100ms MJPEG 100~150ms Note: We use \"end to end\" latency to reflect the actual latency perceived by users: The delay from when a user moves the mouse in the local browser window to when the remote desktop mouse starts moving in the browser. You can use [this Python script](../../../assets/NanoKVM/pro/extended/lat_mouse.py) to actually measure the \"end to end\" latency. Maximize the browser window or place it on the left side, ensuring the current remote desktop background color has maximum contrast with the mouse pointer color (for example, use a white background for a black pointer, or a black background for a white pointer). ``` python lat_mouse.py TEST_CNT RECORD_NAME ``` 4K30 webrtc end to end latency record: ![](./../../../assets/NanoKVM/pro/extended/4K30_latency.png)"},"/hardware/en/kvm/NanoKVM_Pro/faq.html":{"title":"F&Q","content":"# F&Q ## Updating to Solve Issues NanoKVM Pro will periodically update applications, and some issues may have been resolved in newer versions. Therefore, please try updating the application first. ## System Boot ### Green LED Blinking The green LED serves as the power indicator for NanoKVM Pro. If a power source with insufficient capacity is connected, the green LED may blink due to voltage instability and fail to start up. Please disconnect all power connections and replace the power adapter. ### Malfunction After Switching to PiKVM Some devices running application version `1.2.9` may experience repeated PiKVM reboots after switching to PiKVM mode. Please update the application version to `1.2.10` or higher via the NanoKVM Web interface to resolve this issue. If you are unable to switch back to NanoKVM, please refer to [Image Burning Methods](#Image Burning Methods) to re flash the NanoKVM Pro image. ## Network related Issue ### WiFi Version NanoKVM Pro ATX/Desk Missing WiFi Configuration Interface To resolve this issue, please update to version 1.2.13 or above via Settings > Check for Updates. If you are unable to update via the web interface due to network issues, you can try resolving it by re flashing the firmware: First download the firmware image for version [1.0.13](https://github.com/sipeed/NanoKVM Pro/releases/tag/v1.0.13) or above, then follow the [operation steps](https://wiki.sipeed.com/hardware/en/kvm/NanoKVM_Pro/faq.html#Image Burning Methods) to complete the flashing process. ### NanoKVM Pro ATX Unable to Configure Network via OLED Screen In earlier versions \\[1\\], on the Wi Fi variant of the ATX, long pressing the `USR` button may cause the OLED to remain stuck on the `Starting` screen and fail to enter the Wi Fi configuration page. **Temporary Workarounds:** * Connect the device via Ethernet, then log in to the Web interface and complete Wi Fi configuration under `Settings` → `Device` → `Wi Fi`. * Connect the NanoKVM ATX HID interface to a computer. On Windows, run `ipconfig` in the Command Prompt (use `ifconfig` on Linux), and locate the newly added IPv4 address in the form of `10.aaa.bbb.ccc` (for example, `10.223.155.100`). Access the NanoKVM Web interface via `10.aaa.bbb.1`, then complete Wi Fi configuration under `Settings` → `Device` → `Wi Fi`. After successfully connecting to the network, it is recommended to update the application to version `> 1.2.9` to permanently resolve this issue. \\[1\\]: Affected versions: `1.1.8` ~ `1.2.8` ## Video Related Issues ### NanoKVM Pro Cannot Display BIOS and Login Screen When the host has multiple displays, it generally prioritizes the built in screen or DP interface screen for displaying BIOS and login interface by default. Please refer to your motherboard manual to adjust the display priority, or use the loop out interface to connect your display. ### DP Adapter Compatibility Issues DP adapters come in two types: passive and active. Passive DP adapters are low cost but may pose compatibility risks, manifesting as resolution lists not matching EDID, host wake up failing to activate the screen, etc. Using the reset HDMI function can wake up the screen. ### Missing Resolution List, Inconsistent with EDID The resolution list in the host display settings is determined by the host, EDID, (potentially existing) loop out screen, and video adapter collectively. You can switch between different EDIDs on the web page to achieve the most reasonable compatibility. ### HDMI Icon Lit on NanoKVM Screen but No Video Displayed in Web Interface NanoKVM Pro supports video capture and loop out functions. When only capturing video, it reports a maximum resolution of 4K30FPS to the host by default. When a loop out display is connected, it reports a common resolution list. For the default resolution and frame rate list, please refer to [here](https://wiki.sipeed.com/hardware/en/kvm/NanoKVM_Pro/extended.html#How to Modify EDID). When connected through video adapters or docking stations, the reported capabilities may change (e.g., reporting 4K60FPS capture support, which may cause capture failure). In such cases, adjust the display settings in the host system: * On Windows: Go to `Settings` → `Display` → `Advanced Display Settings` → Select `NanoKVM Pro` display → `Display Adapter Properties` → `List All Modes` → Choose the desired mode → Click Apply or OK. ![](./../../../assets/NanoKVM/pro/faq/res.png) ### Blurry Image, Not Matching the Captured Resolution * In the image above, box ③: If the desktop resolution is lower than the active signal resolution, the captured image may appear blurrier than expected.

During installation into the chassis, ensure that both buttons can be pressed and released normally after inserting the PCIe slot. Otherwise, this may cause the NanoKVM to fail to start or result in abnormal functionality. 1. Connect the power. The NanoKVM Pro has slightly higher power requirements, and some motherboard USB ports may not provide sufficient current. To ensure the proper operation of the NanoKVM Pro, it is strongly recommended to use an external power supply of 5V 1A or higher (actual power consumption is about 3W). ![](./../../../assets/NanoKVM/pro/start/01_Power.png) 2. Connect the USB HID interface: + ATX version: can use either internal case wiring or external USB C connection. ![](./../../../assets/NanoKVM/pro/start/02_USB.png) > ❗❗❗For the first batch of users (the cable is different from Figure B below), if you choose the internal chassis wiring method, please check your email and follow the modification instructions provided in the email to connect the cables. Alternatively, refer to [here](https://wiki.sipeed.com/nanokvmpro usb) to modify the cable. ![](./../../../assets/NanoKVM/pro/start/cable.png) 3. Use an Ethernet cable to connect the router/switch to the NanoKVM Pro. If there is no wired network, this step can be skipped; Wi Fi can be configured after powering on (requires purchasing the WiFi version). ![](./../../../assets/NanoKVM/pro/start/05_ETH.png) 4. Connect HDMI IN. If the motherboard has only one video port and an external display is needed, connect HDMI OUT to your display. ![](./../../../assets/NanoKVM/pro/start/06_HDMI.png) > Note that NanoKVM Pro supports a maximum capture of 4K30FPS. The built in HDMI splitter actively reads the resolution and frame rate of the external display and provides a common mode list to the host. > If you connect a 4K60FPS display, the computer will recognize it as a maximum supported 4K30 display (limited by the capture device; you can turn off capture to allow 4K60 direct output to the monitor). > If you connect a 1080P display, the computer will recognize it as a maximum 1080P display (limited by the loop out display). 5. (Optional) Connect the ATX power control interface. ![](./../../../assets/NanoKVM/pro/start/07_ATX.png) ## Internal Network Access ### Connecting to the Network 1. If using a wired connection, after powering on, the KVM will obtain an IP address assigned by the router's DHCP, and this step can be skipped. 2. Wi Fi Connection + The ATX version can configure the network via OLED. The steps are as follows: 1. Connect to the NanoKVM ATX's AP: Long press the USR button, and the KVM will release a Wi Fi signal (AP). The OLED will display this IP information, allowing you to scan the QR code for quick connection. 2. Log in to the webpage to enter the Wi Fi account and password: After connecting to Wi Fi, the OLED will display the webpage link. You can manually enter the URL or scan the QR code for quick access to the webpage for configuration. 3. If needed, you can also connect via USB NCM. ### Accessing the Page 1. For the ATX version: After connecting to the network, the OLED will display the local IP address (E IP is the IP obtained from the wired network; W IP is the IP obtained from the Wi Fi network, automatically switching display by default). 2. Use a computer on the same internal network to input the IP address in a browser (Chrome is recommended) to access the page. ![](./../../../assets/NanoKVM/pro/start/SSL.png) > It is normal to see this warning. NanoKVM Pro has enabled HTTPS for enhanced security and uses a self signed SSL certificate. 3. The default initial account is `admin`, and the password is `admin`. It is strongly recommended to change the account password immediately. 4. Check if the image, keyboard/mouse, and power buttons are functioning correctly. ![](./../../../assets/NanoKVM/pro/start/nanokvm4K.png) ## Remote Connection 1. NanoKVM Pro comes pre installed with the Tailscale application, allowing you to log in with your Tailscale account in the web settings. All devices logged into Tailscale will automatically join the same virtual internal network environment, assigning each device a `100.xxx.xxx.xxx` IP, which can be used to remotely access and control your host. 2.

PiKVM documents a systemd flow; NanoKVM uses BusyBox `init`, so service setup differs. Cloudflare does not provide an official RISC‑V build of `cloudflared`, so support on NanoKVM should be considered community‑maintained. This guide draws from PiKVM’s community documentation on Cloudflare Tunnel. Security considerations covered there are not repeated in full here. > **Audience**: NanoKVM users on BusyBox/SysV `init`. **Scope**: Token‑only tunnel, RISC‑V binary, minimal `init.d` service. ## Prerequisites Cloudflare Zero Trust account and a **remotely‑managed Tunnel** (Dashboard → Access → Tunnels → *Create Tunnel*). Copy the **tunnel token**. Shell access to NanoKVM. RISC‑V build of `cloudflared` (locally compiled with Go). For build notes, see the community discussion: [https://github.com/cloudflare/cloudflared/issues/621](https://github.com/cloudflare/cloudflared/issues/621). (Optional) PiKVM reference for general concepts: [https://docs.pikvm.org/cloudflared/](https://docs.pikvm.org/cloudflared/) > **Security** — The token can start the tunnel. Treat it like a secret. ### Get the cloudflared binary If you are on NanoKVM Pro, you may download the binary directly from the Cloudflare/cloudflared repository or use PiKVM OS, which includes a compatible build and a full guide that this guide references. If you are on NanoKVM (RISCV CPU), use one of the following methods: Download from this automated build that has it's build system fully open source: [https://github.com/Johnnybyzhang/cloudflared riscv/releases](https://github.com/Johnnybyzhang/cloudflared riscv/releases) Follow the reference in official cloudflare/cloudflared repo issue #621 ## Install the binary Place your locally built binary and verify it works. It is recommended to attach external media in the WebUI and place the binary on the USB drive that appears on the system. ```sh install m 0755 /data/cloudflared /usr/sbin/cloudflared /usr/sbin/cloudflared version ``` ## Minimal token‑only configuration Use a config file to avoid exposing the token in the process list. ```sh mkdir p /etc/cloudflared umask 077 cat >/etc/cloudflared/config.yml <<'YAML' no autoupdate: true token: YOUR_TUNNEL_TOKEN_HERE YAML chmod 600 /etc/cloudflared/config.yml ``` **One‑shot foreground test** (useful for first‑run troubleshooting): ```sh cloudflared tunnel config /etc/cloudflared/config.yml no autoupdate run ``` > **Flag order matters** — Global options like ` config`, ` logfile`, ` no autoupdate` must come **before** `run`. ## BusyBox `init` service (no systemd) Create a small `init.d` script that starts **after networking**. The example uses `S45` to follow `S40network`. ```sh cat >/etc/init.d/S45cloudflared <<'SH' #!/bin/sh PATH /usr/sbin:/usr/bin:/sbin:/bin DAEMON \"/usr/sbin/cloudflared\" CONF \"/etc/cloudflared/config.yml\" LOG \"/var/log/cloudflared.log\" PIDFILE \"/var/run/cloudflared.pid\" start() { [ x \"$DAEMON\" ] { echo \"cloudflared not found\"; exit 1; } [ f \"$CONF\" ] { echo \"missing $CONF\"; exit 1; } mkdir p /var/run printf \"Starting cloudflared: \" # Keep cloudflared’s own logfile; silence console output \"$DAEMON\" tunnel config \"$CONF\" logfile \"$LOG\" no autoupdate run >/dev/null 2>&1 & echo $! >\"$PIDFILE\" echo \"OK\" } stop() { printf \"Stopping cloudflared: \" if [ f \"$PIDFILE\" ] && kill 0 \"$(cat \"$PIDFILE\")\" 2>/dev/null; then kill \"$(cat \"$PIDFILE\")\" 2>/dev/null true sleep 2 kill 0 \"$(cat \"$PIDFILE\")\" 2>/dev/null && kill 9 \"$(cat \"$PIDFILE\")\" 2>/dev/null true rm f \"$PIDFILE\" echo \"OK\" else killall cloudflared 2>/dev/null && echo \"OK\" echo \"not running\" fi } status() { if [ f \"$PIDFILE\" ] && kill 0 \"$(cat \"$PIDFILE\")\" 2>/dev/null; then echo \"cloudflared running (pid $(cat \"$PIDFILE\"))\" else echo \"cloudflared stopped\"; exit 1 fi } case \"$1\" in start) start ;; stop) stop ;; restartreload) stop; start ;; status) status ;; *) echo \"Usage: $0 {startstoprestartstatus}\"; exit 1 ;; esac exit 0 SH chmod +x /etc/init.d/S45cloudflared ``` **Enable & verify** ```sh /etc/init.d/S45cloudflared start /etc/init.d/S45cloudflared status tail n 100 /var/log/cloudflared.log ``` > **Why logs might appear in your terminal** — If you start your own init.d script interactively, the child process may inherit your TTY. The script example above redirects output with `>/dev/null 2>&1` and uses ` logfile` for persistent logs. ## Networking & time Only **outbound** connectivity is required: TCP/443 (and optionally UDP/7844 for QUIC). Keep device time accurate (NTP) to avoid TLS issues. ## Troubleshooting and suggestions (If you choose to create your own init.d script) **“flag provided but not defined: config”** → Place ` config` **before** `run`. **No logs** → Check `/var/log/cloudflared.log` and file perms; verify ` logfile` path exists. **Stop doesn’t work** → On first connect ` pidfile` can be used; otherwise the fallback `killall` path helps if the pidfile vanished. **Token safety** → Avoid ` token` on the command line; prefer the config file. ## Uninstall / disable ```sh /etc/init.d/S45cloudflared stop chmod x /etc/init.d/S45cloudflared rm f /usr/sbin/cloudflared /etc/cloudflared/config.yml /var/log/cloudflared.log /var/run/cloudflared.pid ``` ## References PiKVM: Cloudflare Tunnels (general concepts, systemd‑based): [https://docs.pikvm.org/cloudflared/](https://docs.pikvm.org/cloudflared/) RISC‑V build discussion for cloudflared: [https://github.com/cloudflare/cloudflared/issues/621](https://github.com/cloudflare/cloudflared/issues/621)"},"/hardware/en/kvm/NanoKVM/network/frp.html":{"title":"frp","content":" title: frp keywords: NanoKVM, Remote desktop, Lichee, PiKVM, RISCV, tool update: date: 2024 8 13 version: v0.1 author: xwj content: Release docs > Note: Exposing services directly to the public internet is very dangerous! It is recommended to use HTTPS. To use frp, you need to create your own configuration file. You can refer to the [frp documentation](https://gofrp.org). Here is an example to access an [internal web service via frp](https://gofrp.org/zh cn/docs/examples/vhost http/). ## Start the frps Service First, you need a server with a public IP address and start the frps service on it. Let's assume the server IP address is `20.190.1.1`. Replace this IP with your own public IP. 1. Download and extract [frp](https://github.com/fatedier/frp/releases/download/v0.59.0/frp_0.59.0_linux_riscv64.tar.gzf). After extracting, go to the folder: ```bash wget https://github.com/fatedier/frp/releases/download/v0.59.0/frp_0.59.0_linux_riscv64.tar.gz tar xzvf frp_0.59.0_linux_riscv64.tar.gz cd frp_0.59.0_linux_riscv64 ``` 2. Create the configuration file `frps.yaml`: ```yaml bindPort: 7000 vhostHTTPPort: 8080 ``` 3. Start the frps service: ```bash ./frps c frps.yaml ``` ## Start the frpc Service 1. SSH into the NanoKVM; 2. Run `frpc v` to check the version. If there is no output, install frpc manually; Download and extract [frp](https://github.com/fatedier/frp/releases/download/v0.59.0/frp_0.59.0_linux_riscv64.tar.gzf); Move the `frpc` file to the `/usr/bin/` directory. 3.

If you want to always access NanoKVM using the same IP address, you can set a static IP. Here are two methods to set a static IP: ## Setting Static IP via Router Most routers have a feature for setting static IPs for devices. If you can easily access the router's management page, it's recommended to use this method. In the router management interface, you can find the device with the name `kvm` and set the IP directly. ## Setting Static IP in NanoKVM If accessing the router's backend is not convenient, you can also set the static IP directly in NanoKVM. Here’s how: ### Setting Static IP Create a file `/boot/eth.nodhcp` in NanoKVM and edit it as follows: Each line represents a custom IP in the format `addr/netid gw[optional]`; You can preset multiple static IPs on multiple lines. ```bash # Example 192.168.0.101/24 192.168.0.1 # addr/netid gw 192.168.3.116/22 # addr/netid ``` After editing and saving the file, run the command `/etc/init.d/S30eth restart` to apply the configuration. **Note:** If all preset static IP addresses are detected by ARP as already in use, setting the static IP will fail. In this case, DHCP will be triggered to obtain an IP address. If this also fails, the IP will be forcibly set to `192.168.90.1/24`. This ensures that NanoKVM always has a usable IP address, allowing network access to operate NanoKVM. If NanoKVM does not receive a valid IP address, you will need to manually modify the file on the TF card or reflash the image to use it normally. ### Canceling the Static IP Delete the `/boot/eth.nodhcp` file to cancel the static IP setting. NanoKVM will then obtain its IP address via DHCP again."},"/hardware/en/kvm/NanoKVM/ipmi.html":{"title":"IPMI Operation Manual","content":" title: IPMI Operation Manual keywords: IPMI, NanoKVM, Remote desktop, PiKVM, RISCV, tool > 💡 Prerequisite: Update your system image to [v1.4.2](https://github.com/sipeed/NanoKVM/releases/tag/v1.4.2) or a later version before proceeding. ## Project Overview This project provides a software based IPMI simulator. It allows users to remotely manage hardware power states and access the Serial Over LAN console using standard IPMI protocols. Core Components: **`ipmi_sim`**: The main open source IPMI simulator binary (part of OpenIPMI). **`ipmi sim.sh`**: Service management script responsible for starting, stopping, and monitoring the simulator process. **`chassis_control.sh`**: Hardware Abstraction Layer (HAL) script that controls physical hardware power/reset pins via GPIO. **`lan.conf`**: Configuration file defining users, network interfaces, and SOL serial parameters. ## Accessing the Device Before starting the installation and configuration, you need to log in to the NanoKVM system terminal. There are two ways to do this: ### Method 1: Web Terminal 1. Enter the NanoKVM IP address in your browser address bar to access the Web UI. 2. Locate the **Terminal** icon in the menu bar and open the **Web Terminal**. ### Method 2: SSH Login If you prefer using command line tools, you can connect via SSH. 1. Open a terminal on your computer. 2. Run the following command (replace `<IP_Address>` with the actual IP of your NanoKVM): ```bash ssh root@<IP_Address> ``` 3. Enter the default password `root` to log in. ## Installation & Deployment The service is designed to be installed in the `/etc/ipmi` directory. ### Directory Structure Ensure your system follows this file structure: ```text /etc/ipmi/ ├── ipmi sim.sh # Service control script ├── chassis_control.sh # Hardware control script ├── lan.conf # Main configuration file ├── sim.emu # Simulator persistence data ``` ## Configuration Guide ### Users & Passwords (`lan.conf`) The default configuration includes a single admin account. **For security, it is highly recommended to change the default password before deployment.** Edit the user section at the bottom of `/etc/ipmi/lan.conf`: ```text # User 2: Admin user # Enabled Username Password Privilege Max_Sessions Auth_Type user 2 true \"admin\" \"admin\" admin 10 md5 ``` Change `\"admin\"` (the password field) to your desired password. ### Serial Over LAN (SOL) To enable viewing device serial output via IPMI, configure the `sol` option in `lan.conf`: ```text # Map to the physical serial device, e.g., /dev/ttyS1 sol \"/dev/ttyS1\" 115200 nortscts ``` ## Service Management Use the `ipmi sim.sh` script to manage the service. ### Common Commands Operation Command Description : : : **Start Service** `/etc/ipmi/ipmi sim.sh start` Start the IPMI simulator background process **Stop Service** `/etc/ipmi/ipmi sim.sh stop` Stop the running service **Restart Service** `/etc/ipmi/ipmi sim.sh restart` Stop and then start the service **Check Status** `/etc/ipmi/ipmi sim.sh status` Check if service is running and view PID **Enable Auto Start** `/etc/ipmi/ipmi sim.sh enable` Configure service to start automatically on boot **Disable Auto Start** `/etc/ipmi/ipmi sim.sh disable` Disable auto start on boot ### Example ```bash # Enable auto start and start the service immediately /etc/ipmi/ipmi sim.sh enable /etc/ipmi/ipmi sim.sh start ``` ## Client Usage (ipmitool) You can manage the device remotely from any machine with an IPMI client (like `ipmitool` on Linux/macOS). **Connection Parameters:** ` H`: Target IP address (e.g., NanoKVM IP) ` U`: Username (default: admin) ` P`: Password (default: admin) ` I`: Interface type (use `lanplus` for IPMI 2.0) ` C`: Cipher Suite. **It it recommended to use ` C 3`** to skip the long protocol negotiation process. ### Supported Command List This project currently only supports the following core IPMI commands: Category Command (ipmitool) Description : : : **Power** `power status` Check current power state (ON/OFF) `power on` Turn on the system `power off` Turn off the system (Force/Hard shutdown) `power reset` Reset the system (Reboot) **SOL** `sol activate` Start Serial Over LAN session `sol deactivate` Terminate Serial Over LAN session **Management** `mc info` View BMC basic information ### Power Control ```bash # Check power status ipmitool H <IP> U admin P admin I lanplus power status # Power On ipmitool H <IP> U admin P admin I lanplus power on # Power Off (Hard shutdown) ipmitool H <IP> U admin P admin I lanplus power off # Reset (Reboot) ipmitool H <IP> U admin P admin I lanplus power reset ``` ### Serial Over LAN (SOL) Connect to the device's serial console over the network: ```bash # Activate SOL session ipmitool H <IP> U admin P admin I lanplus sol activate # Deactivate/Exit SOL session # Key sequence: ~ + . (Tilde followed by Dot) ``` *Note: If the SOL connection fails, verify the serial device path in `lan.conf` and ensure no other process is locking the serial port.* ### 6.4 Performance Optimization By default, `ipmitool` attempts to negotiate the encryption protocol with the server, which can cause a delay of several seconds before every command execution. **Solution**: Explicitly add the ` C 3` parameter to your commands. **Optimized Command Examples:** ```bash # 1. Quickly get BMC info (Recommended test command) ipmitool H <IP> U admin P admin I lanplus C 3 mc info # 2. Quickly check power status ipmitool H <IP> U admin P admin I lanplus C 3 power status # 3. Quickly activate SOL ipmitool H <IP> U admin P admin I lanplus C 3 sol activate ``` ## Troubleshooting 1. **Service Fails to Start** Check if port 623 (UDP) is already in use: `netstat ln grep 623` Check system logs. Try running the underlying command manually in the foreground to see error messages. 2. **ipmitool Connection Timeout** Check firewall settings; ensure UDP port 623 is open. Verify the `ipmi_sim` process is running: `ps aux grep ipmi_sim`."},"/hardware/en/kvm/NanoKVM/quick_start.html":{"title":"Quick Start","content":" title: Quick Start keywords: NanoKVM, Remote desktop, Lichee, PiKVM, RISCV, tool update: date: 2024 7 4 version: v0.1 author: BuGu content: Release docs update: date: 2024 8 15 version: v0.1 author: BuGu content: Update docs ## Unboxing ![](./../../../assets/NanoKVM/unbox/full_ubox.png) The Full version includes NanoKVM (with case, with card), KVM B board, 2 USB A to C cables, and Dupont cables. ![](./../../../assets/NanoKVM/unbox/lite_ubox.png) The Lite version includes NanoKVM (without case and Micro SD card) and a heatsink. ## Interface Introduction ![](./../../../assets/NanoKVM/unbox/Interface.png) + **The Full version features three USB Type C interfaces with the following names and functions** + HID Interface (also called PC USB), located below the HDMI interface, is used to connect the host, simulate keyboard and mouse, USB drive, and RNDIS devices. + AUX Interface, located above the HDMI interface, provides auxiliary power supply. + KVM B Interface (also called ATX Power), located above the Ethernet port, connects to KVM B for power control functions. ## Power Supply + NanoKVM supports 5V power supply via regular USB, with a power consumption of about 1W. Some older motherboard models may have insufficient current, requiring additional power supply through the AUX interface. ![](./../../../assets/NanoKVM/unbox/U I W.jpg) + Some motherboards' BIOS settings may default to turning off USB power when shut down. To ensure NanoKVM remains powered, please provide an additional 5V power supply through the AUX interface. + NanoKVM's USB CC interface features a 5.1K pull down resistor, allowing the use of standard PD chargers. Some low quality power supplies may output 12V directly without negotiation, which can damage NanoKVM. Note: The first batch of internal test versions of the AUX interface does not include a CC pull down resistor and cannot use C C PD chargers. Please use a conventional 5V USB power adapter. ## Wiring The wiring diagram for the NanoKVM Full version is as follows. The Lite version only includes USB C, HDMI, and Ethernet ports, and can refer to the Full version for wiring. + Use a USB C to A data cable to connect the remote host to the PC USB interface of NanoKVM (located below the HDMI interface). + Connect an HDMI (standard size) cable between the remote host and the HDMI interface of NanoKVM. ![](./../../../assets/NanoKVM/unbox/hdmi.png) + Connect NanoKVM to a router/switch using an Ethernet cable. > Note: In some cases NanoKVM Ethernet port might not work due to electromagnetic interference. In such cases shielded Ethernet cable is recommended. + Use another USB C to A data cable to connect the KVM B board to the ATX interface of NanoKVM (located above the Ethernet port). The official KVM B board features a standard 9 pin header interface compatible with most motherboards, allowing direct connection. The case's power button and Power LED can be connected to the KVM B header, as shown in the diagram (only the power button is connected here): ![](./../../../assets/NanoKVM/unbox/new ATX B.png) > Note: The KVM B board with version number 30132 cannot be directly connected to the pin header on the board with the built in 9 pin bus header of the chassis, and must be connected with the included male to female cable according to the figure above. The wiring diagram for the internal test version of the KVM B board and the host's 9 pin interface is shown below. The double row headers are interconnected, allowing the connection of the case's power button and Power LED to the other row. > Note: In the early stage, the NanoKVM reboot will briefly pull up the RESET control pin, causing the connected computer to restart, in order to avoid this problem, please do not connect the RESET jumper, which has been fixed in the later official version ![](./../../../assets/NanoKVM/unbox/old ATX B.png) ![](./../../../assets/NanoKVM/unbox/old ATX B w.png) Note: NanoKVM Cube does not monitor HDD status. ## Updates ### Update Image > **The Lite version requires preparing a Micro SD card and flashing the image before use!** The Full version comes with a pre flashed image and can skip this step.

The corresponding relationship between IO and functions is as follows: Alpha version definition (including early NanoKVM Cube) Function Linux GPIO Number PWR LED Input 504 PWR KEY Output 503 RST KEY Output 507 Beta version definition (including later NanoKVM Cube and all NanoKVM PCIe) Function Linux GPIO Number PWR LED Input 504 PWR KEY Output 503 RST KEY Output 505 + Read LED status (using Beta as an example) ```shell cat /sys/class/gpio/gpio504/value # 0 > LED on # 1 > LED off ``` + Operate power button (using Beta as an example) ```shell # Press down echo 1 > /sys/class/gpio/gpio503/value # Wait for 1 second sleep 1 # Release echo 0 > /sys/class/gpio/gpio503/value ``` + Operate reset button (using Beta as an example) ```shell # Press down echo 1 > /sys/class/gpio/gpio505/value # Wait for 1 second sleep 1 # Release echo 0 > /sys/class/gpio/gpio505/value ``` + For other IO: Please refer to [LicheeRV Nano GPIO](https://wiki.sipeed.com/hardware/zh/lichee/RV_Nano/5_peripheral.html#LicheeRV Nano%E5%BC%95%E8%84%9A%E5%9B%BE%26amp%3BLinux GPIO%E7%BC%96%E5%8F%B7%EF%BC%9A) for development. ## Precautions Users should not place their own built programs in the `/kvmapp` directory, as any updates will reset all contents within the folder. Simulated keyboard and mouse operations may conflict with operations on the front end page."},"/hardware/en/kvm/NanoKVM/user_guide.html":{"title":"User Guide","content":" title: User Guide keywords: NanoKVM, Remote desktop, Lichee, PiKVM, RISCV, tool update: date: 2024/7/4 version: v0.1 author: BuGu content: Release docs date: 2024/8/14 version: v1.1 author: BuGu content: Update docs date: 2024/12/11 version: v1.2 author: BuGu content: Modify error description ## OLED Interface ![](./../../../assets/NanoKVM/unbox/oled.jpg) + Displays the connection status of Ethernet, USB, and HDMI. Icons will invert color when connected. + IP: When Ethernet is connected, NanoKVM will automatically obtain an IP and display it on the OLED. If the gateway is unreachable, a `!` will be displayed before the IP. + RES: Shows the current transmission resolution, default is 720P. + TYPE: Displays the transmission type, currently only supports MJPG, H264 is under development. + STREAM: Shows the real time transmission frame rate. Frame difference detection is enabled by default (transmission stops when the screen is static). When the screen is static, FPS shows 0. + QUALITY: Shows compression quality, ranging from 50 100%, default is 80%. + The main interface provides an OLED sleep function to prevent screen burn in; a short press of the BOOT button can turn the OLED off or on. + After applying version `2.1.4`, the OLED automatic sleep feature has been added: After setting the sleep time in the settings, the OLED will automatically enter sleep mode after the specified time. Pressing the BOOT button can temporarily wake up the OLED. ## Management Page Features ![](./../../../assets/NanoKVM/introduce/web_ui.gif) The floating toolbar from left to right includes: Image Settings, On Screen Keyboard, Mouse Style, Image Mounting, Custom Scripts, KVM Web Terminal, WOL, ATX Control/Indicator, Settings, Full Screen, and Hide Floating Toolbar. ### Resolution, Frame Rate, and Image Quality Settings + NanoKVM supports 1080P, 720P, 600P, and 480P image transmission. Different resolutions can be selected in Image Settings > Resolution. Higher resolutions use more bandwidth and lower real time frame rates. + Note: This only changes the transmitted image size, not the HDMI input image size. To change that, please go to the host system's settings menu. + The Frame Rate setting option is used to modify the maximum transmission frame rate, which can limit network bandwidth usage. However, lower frame rates result in choppier images. Configure according to network conditions. Full version users can see the real time video frame rate on the OLED. + The Image Quality option can modify the compression ratio. If the image appears choppy or has high latency, you can reduce the image quality. + Frame Difference Detection + NanoKVM enables frame difference detection by default, stopping image transmission when the screen is static to save bandwidth. + This feature uses approximately 2.5% of CPU resources, with a 0.2s delay from static to dynamic images. Click `Display` > `Frame Difference Detection` to disable or enable this feature. ### Virtual Keyboard and Mouse Usage + The USB port of NanoKVM simulates keyboard and mouse devices. Once the browser page is opened, the system will automatically capture keyboard and mouse input and sync operations to the host connected to NanoKVM in real time. Users can choose to hide the mouse or change its display style on the screen. + For users who find it inconvenient to use a keyboard, we provide an on screen keyboard. Click the keyboard icon on the floating toolbar to bring up the on screen keyboard. ### ISO Image Mounting and Remote Installation + Besides simulating keyboard and mouse devices, the USB C port of NanoKVM also simulates a USB drive, mounting part of the TF card's storage space for installation needs. This USB drive is formatted as exFAT by default. The Full version NanoKVM has a built in TF card with approximately 21GB of storage for the simulated USB drive. + Unlike a regular USB drive, NanoKVM's virtual USB drive can store multiple images simultaneously. Before starting, users can select the system image to be installed through the web page options. Users need to download the installation images (usually ending in .iso) in advance, insert NanoKVM USB C into the computer, and copy the downloaded images directly into the USB drive (multiple systems can be copied). Then, disconnect it. Connect the remote host to NanoKVM as described above, log in to the system via the browser, click the CD icon, and select the system to be installed for ISO mounting. ![](./../../../assets/NanoKVM/guide/imgsl.png) Next, start the installation process by clicking `Power On (Short Press)` and quickly pressing the F11 key on the keyboard (keys may vary by host, refer to the host manual), select the corresponding image to boot and complete the installation process. ![](./../../../assets/NanoKVM/guide/install.png) Note: + The virtual USB drive feature is enabled by default. If not needed, it can be disabled by clicking `Settings` > `Virtual USB Drive`. + Please eject the original 21G virtual USB flash drive on the host before mounting the image to avoid data loss. + The virtual USB drive can also be used as a regular USB drive. If no image is selected in the web interface, the entire 21GB virtual USB drive will be mounted by default. + Users can also use the conventional card burning method to burn images, though it's not recommended. + The speed of copying images to NanoKVM is limited by USB2.0 transfer speed and SG2002 card writing speed, which may be slow. Users can remove the TF card, insert it into the computer, [unlock the hidden](https://jingyan.baidu.com/article/e4511cf34faece2b845eaf34.html) third partition of the TF card, and directly copy the images into it. + The virtual USB drive is also mounted to the `/data` directory of NanoKVM, allowing users to read and write to this partition directly from the NanoKVM terminal. + Canceling the virtual USB flash drive operation in the settings will force the USB flash drive to eject the USB flash drive, please eject the USB flash drive safely before setting it up to avoid data loss. ### Web Terminal + By clicking the `Terminal` > `NanoKVM Terminal` icon on the floating toolbar, users can open the web terminal and access the NanoKVM system directly without SSH. + When NanoKVM reconnects after a network disconnection or system reboot, the web terminal will prompt for re login. The username is `root` and the password is `root`. ![](./../../../assets/NanoKVM/guide/ssh.png) ### Serial Terminal NanoKVM is built on the LicheeRV Nano, which has 3 UART ports. UART0 is used for system log output by default. In the Full version of NanoKVM, UART1/2 are exposed, allowing users to expand functionality (the first batch of beta versions have holes in the shell for this purpose). ![](./../../../assets/NanoKVM/guide/uart_to_3H.jpg) Click `Terminal` on the management page, select `Serial Terminal`, choose the serial port to use, enter the baud rate, and click Start to use it. ![](./../../../assets/NanoKVM/guide/uart1.png) ![](./../../../assets/NanoKVM/guide/uart2.png) Note: The serial terminal feature uses WebSSH + picocom, and the usage is similar to picocom. ### RNDIS NanoKVM's USB will default to simulate an RNDIS USB network card (slave device), which can be used for system maintenance when the NanoKVM service is abnormal. Refer to [here](https://wiki.sipeed.com/hardware/zh/kvm/NanoKVM/system/updating.html#%E9%80%9A%E8%BF%87 usb rndis %E7%BD%91%E5%8F%A3%E8%8E%B7%E5%8F%96) to connect to a computer, and explore more usages yourself. If you do not use the RNDIS feature, it can be disabled by clicking `Settings` > `RNDIS`. Note: The NCM connection method was added after version 2.1.5, but the default remains RNDIS. To enable it, use: touch /boot/usb.ncm or create an empty file named usb.ncm in the /boot partition. ### ATX Power Control + On the right side of the floating toolbar, there are power and hard disk icons. Normally, they are gray. After powering on, the power icon turns green. + Click the power icon to see the reset button and power button (long/short press). + The Full version ATX control board is limited by the number of extension lines, only the power, reset buttons, and power light are exposed, so it is normal for the HDD LED to not light up. Lite users can extend functionality according to the schematic. Note: + The official version of NanoKVM A hardware reserves pins for the WiFi module and modifies the OLED and some ATX pins. The firmware will automatically detect the hardware version and adapt. + The Lite version of NanoKVM does not include NanoKVM A/B, and the firmware will directly recognize it as the official version. ### Settings + Switch between Chinese and English. + About NanoKVM: Click to open the Wiki. + Check for updates: When updates are available, users can click to update. The web page will automatically refresh and re login after about 15 seconds to complete the update. + Version 2.2.5 introduces a preview update feature. Enable this option to pull the latest preview version. Note: Preview applications generally include feature updates, bug fixes, and performance improvements, but there is still a chance of introducing new bugs. Please update with caution. ### About SSH + In version 2.1.6 and later, SSH can be enabled or permanently disabled from the web interface under Settings > Devices > SSH. + In version 1.4.0, SSH is disabled by default. 1. **Permanently Disable:** Execute `touch /etc/kvm/ssh_stop` to disable SSH login on the next boot. To enable it again, remove the file using `rm /etc/kvm/ssh_stop`. 2. **Temporarily Enable:** Execute `touch /boot/start_ssh_once` or create an empty file named `start_ssh_once` in the /boot partition. This will enable SSH on the next boot, and the file will be automatically deleted. ### Setting DNS + If you need to set a DNS list, create `/boot/resolv.conf`. This will enforce your own DNS configuration after booting. ### About mDNS + mDNS (Multicast DNS) is a protocol used for name resolution within a local network, allowing devices to discover and communicate with each other using hostnames instead of IP addresses. It enables automatic discovery of services and devices on the network without a central DNS server. + NanoKVM generates mDNS hostnames based on the device code to minimize conflicts when multiple devices are present. + The device name for NanoKVM can be modified in the settings and will take effect after a restart. + mDNS services can lead to higher CPU usage in complex network environments, affecting image smoothness. It is recommended to disable it when not in use: Settings > Devices > mDNS. ### About the Watchdog + The watchdog system was added in version 2.2.2 to continuously monitor the server service. If the service encounters an exception, the system will restart. By default, it is disabled. You can enable it by executing `touch /etc/kvm/watchdog` in the web terminal and disable it with `rm /etc/kvm/watchdog`. ### More Features Coming Soon! ## Network Latency Estimation Connect the host to KVM and a regular screen, play a stopwatch video, capture the remote desktop and display screen, and calculate the difference to estimate network latency. ## Hardware and Structure ### Disassembly Full version NanoKVM requires disassembly for re flashing the card. Follow the steps below to disassemble the shell. ![](./../../../assets/NanoKVM/guide/fix1.png) 1. Remove the 4 screws at the bottom. 2. Push the NanoKVM out of the shell using the HDMI and Ethernet ports. 3. Remove the heatsink to pull out the TF card. ### Differences Between Beta and Official Versions The official version hardware reserves pins for the WiFi module and modifies the OLED and ATX pin allocations as shown below. ![](./../../../assets/NanoKVM/guide/PinDefine.png) To ensure compatibility with both hardware versions, the software has been designed with adaptive features. Beta users and official version users can update with confidence. ATX Wiring: ![](./../../../assets/NanoKVM/guide/atx_2024.png) NanoKVM Full version comes with an integrated ATX control board. Beta users can add the ATX extension board to the Lite version. The official firmware for NanoKVM Full version is universal and compatible with all versions. The ATX control interface supports configurations for power light, hard disk light, reset, and power buttons. Refer to the wiring diagram for assembly. For Lite version users, the software adapts to their board, and there's no hardware auto detection feature. If users need ATX support, they can manually update the firmware to the Full version and add the necessary hardware extensions. ## Firmware and Software Updates ### Firmware Update Updating the firmware requires disassembling the Full version NanoKVM. For Lite version users, follow these steps to update: 1. Visit the official NanoKVM website to download the latest firmware. 2. Power off the NanoKVM and remove the TF card. 3. Connect the TF card to your computer using a card reader. 4. Copy the downloaded firmware to the root directory of the TF card. 5. Reinsert the TF card into NanoKVM, reassemble, and power it on. 6. The NanoKVM will automatically update the firmware. ### Software Update Users can check for software updates via the NanoKVM management page: 1. Open the NanoKVM management page in a browser. 2. Click `Settings` > `Check for Updates`. 3. If an update is available, click `Update` to begin the process. 4.

If you encounter issues, please update the application first. If you cannot update via the web interface, please follow the steps below for a forced update:** 1. Refer to [this link](https://wiki.sipeed.com/hardware/zh/kvm/NanoKVM/system/updating.html#%E8%8E%B7%E5%8F%96 IP) to connect the development board. 2. Execute: `python /etc/kvm/update nanokvm.py` > Users outside of China may experience download failures due to DNS issues. Please add `nameserver 119.29.29.29` or `nameserver 223.5.5.5` to `/etc/resolv.conf` and try again. > Earlier versions of the application may not have this script file. Please download [here](https://github.com/sipeed/NanoKVM/blob/main/kvmapp/system/update nanokvm.py), extract it, and grant execute permissions before trying again. ### About Password 1. After updating to version 2.1.5, if you haven't set a web password before, you will be prompted to change the password upon logging in. When you change the password, the backend `root` password will also be synchronized to the web password. If you have already changed the web password before, the backend `root` password will not be changed automatically. You can modify it using `passwd` in the terminal or click \"Reset Password\" in the web settings. 2. If the application version is greater than 2.1.5 and you forget the password, you can press the `BOOT` button on the device for more than 10 seconds (the BOOT button for the NanoKVM Cube is located next to the USB HID interface, while the PCIe version can be found on the panel. Older versions of the NanoKVM Full may not have a hole in the corresponding location and require disassembly). 3. If holding down the button does not reset the password, it may be because the application version is less than 2.1.5. Please refer to [here](https://wiki.sipeed.com/hardware/en/kvm/NanoKVM/system/flashing.html) to reflash the image. Note that reflashing the image will erase all configuration information. ### HID Keyboard and Mouse Not Working 1. Use the \"Reset HID\" feature in the web interface. 2. Some host systems have high requirements for USB keyboards and mice, needing to use \"HID Only\" mode. In this mode, USB only simulates keyboard and mouse devices. Please switch to this mode using the mouse icon in the web interface. 3. Some motherboard systems require HID keyboard and mouse devices to have a BIOS identifier. NanoKVM can create a BIOS in `/boot` to enable this feature. Execute `touch /boot/BIOS && restart`. 4. Check if the USB connection is stable. You can see if the HID icon on the OLED is lit, or use `cat /sys/class/udc/4340000.usb/state` in the web terminal. If it shows \"not connected,\" then the USB cable may be faulty. Please replace the USB cable and try again. ### BIOS Does Not Recognize HID Keyboard and Mouse 1. Some host systems have high requirements for USB keyboards and mice, needing to use \"HID Only\" mode. In this mode, USB only simulates keyboard and mouse devices that support BIOS. Please switch to this mode using the mouse icon in the web interface. 2. Use the \"Reset HID\" feature in the web interface. ### Incorrect Key Mapping for Non English Keyboards + The keyboard layout needs to be modified in the controlled host system settings. For example, to modify a French keyboard in Ubuntu: Settings > Keyboard > Input Sources > ‘+’ > Add > Search \"French,\" then add. ### STA LED Not Flashing Normally The STA LED indicates the operating status of the NanoKVM. When functioning properly, the STA LED should flash irregularly. If the STA LED is continuously on or off, or exhibits regular intermittent extinguishing, the NanoKVM may be malfunctioning. 1. If the STA LED intermittently extinguishes after powering on: The system did not detect the system on the TF card. Please check if the TF card is properly inserted and reflash the TF image. 2. If the STA LED is off for an extended period: This is usually due to a lack of power. Please check the power supply status. > If powered only by USB HID, the USB power may disconnect when the computer is shut down. Please refer to relevant documentation to set USB to always supply power in the BIOS, or use auxiliary power. > Connecting to an unconventional power supply may damage the NanoKVM and cause the STA LED to extinguish. 3. If the STA LED remains on for an extended period without flashing: This situation generally should not occur with the official system and applications. If custom functions are configured within the NanoKVM system, there is a chance it may cause the system to freeze, leaving the STA LED lit. It is recommended to reflash the image. ### Unable to Obtain IP Address 1. Lite users should first check if a TF card is inserted. The Lite version is shipped without a card by default, so users need to provide their own TF card. Please follow the instructions [here](https://wiki.sipeed.com/hardware/zh/kvm/NanoKVM/system/flashing.html) to flash the card and retry. 2. Check if the network switch supports 100M. Some newer switches do not support 100M connections; please replace the switch and try again. 3. The NanoKVM Cube (including NanoKVM Full and NanoKVM Lite) may be unable to obtain an IP address when connecting to certain power sources/HDMI. Please confirm the following: > Disconnect all interfaces and power the device using a power bank, then connect the network cable to see if an IP can be obtained. > If an IP can be obtained, reconnect HDMI/computer USB to check if the IP exists. > If the IP exists only when powered by the power bank, but disappears after connecting HDMI/computer USB, this indicates the issue. Please contact customer service to purchase an isolator to resolve it. ### No Display After Logging into the Browser Interface 1. The controlled host may be in sleep mode. Try pressing any key on the keyboard to wake it up. 2. Non Chrome browsers may experience issues with H264 not displaying, while MJPEG mode works normally. Please try again using Chrome. 3. For the PCIe version, try clicking the reset HDMI option under the \"Video\" icon. 4. For the Cube version, you can try unplugging and replugging the HDMI cable after opening the webpage. 5. Check the resolution on the OLED or enter `echo \"$(cat /kvmapp/kvm/width) * $(cat /kvmapp/kvm/height)\"` in the web terminal, and compare it with the resolution of the controlled host. If they differ, you can manually set the resolution using `echo xxx > /kvmapp/kvm/width && echo xxx > /kvmapp/kvm/height`. > If the host system is Windows, the resolution shown in display settings may not match the actual resolution. Check in Advanced > Active Signal Resolution. 6. The early test version of Full NanoKVM uses standard cables to connect to the HDMI capture board, which may not detect the HDMI signal due to poor connections. You can reconnect the cable as shown in the image below or contact customer service to purchase dedicated cables. [](./../../../assets/NanoKVM/guide/Old_fix.png) 7. Try restarting to resolve the issue: execute `reboot` in the web terminal. 8. If the above methods do not identify the problem, execute `cat /proc/cvitek/vi_dbg` in the web terminal. > If `VIDevFPS` is 0, it means NanoKVM cannot get HDMI input. Check the following issues: Is the host outputting a video signal? Is the HDMI cable damaged? Is the Cube an early version with possible connection issues? > If `VIDevFPS` is not 0 and `VIFPS` is 0, it indicates that NanoKVM is not correctly configured for HDMI parameters. The Cube can replug the HDMI to auto detect, while PCIe can click `Reset HDMI` under `Video` to auto detect. > Check if `VIInImgWidth` and `VIInImgHeight` match the actual HDMI resolution. If they are different, it means NanoKVM did not auto detect the correct HDMI parameters. Manually configure the resolution parameters as described in point 4. ### No Display After Host Wakes from Sleep 1. Check if you are using a cheap DP to HDMI (passive adapter). These types of adapters lack a proper wake mechanism and cannot notify the NanoKVM that the display has been restored. 2. For PCIe versions, you can click the \"Reset HDMI\" button to forcefully retrieve the display. 3. The Cube/Lite versions lack a reset function; please switch to an active DP adapter. ### Serious screen delay in internal network environment 1. Try replacing the switch or power supply 2. If it is invalid, please contact after sales service ### OLED Displaying Information Normally, But Unable to Open Webpage 1. Please force update the application. ### OLED Not Lighting Up The NanoKVM Full and PCIe versions come with an OLED to display information such as IP. If the OLED does not light up, please follow these steps to troubleshoot: 1. Version `2.1.4` added an OLED sleep function; pressing the BOOT button can temporarily turn on the OLED. 2. If the STA LED is flashing abnormally, first check whether the system is booting normally, and follow the steps outlined in “STA LED Not Flashing Normally” to troubleshoot. 3. Try a forced update or reflash the system. ### About Memory 1. The total memory (RAM) space of NanoKVM is 256MB, with a dedicated ion memory area used for video image processing. The memory viewed in user space will be less than 256MB. 2. Firmware versions lower than 1.3.0 reserve only 128MB of memory for user space. All images from version 1.3.0 and later increase the memory size to 158MB, which is beneficial for Tailscale to run for long periods. Users in need should update the image according to the steps [here]. 3. Enable \"Memory Optimization\" in the settings. ### Host Abnormal Restart + In the early beta version, when the Full NanoKVM ATX board is connected to the host's RESET pin, the host may restart when the NanoKVM is rebooted. Please disconnect the RESET jumper or contact customer service to purchase stable version accessories. ### Current Backflow + The early beta version of the Full NanoKVM has a current backflow issue: When the host is powered off and the USB has no power output, current will flow back into the host when connecting the auxiliary power supply. 1. It is recommended to set the USB to remain powered after the host is shut down. 2. For Full version users: Use a soldering iron to disconnect the 5V resistor or header short circuit at the indicated position in the image below, supplying power only through the auxiliary power port. ![](./../../../assets/NanoKVM/guide/fix2.png) ### Try Power Cycling to Solve Unknown Issues ### If there are network disconnections or other abnormal situations during the update, it may lead to a failed update. Please refer to the following solutions: 1. Refer to [here](https://wiki.sipeed.com/hardware/zh/kvm/NanoKVM/system/updating.html#%E8%8E%B7%E5%8F%96 IP) to connect the development board. 2. Execute `rm r /kvmapp && cp r /root/old/ / && mv /old/kvmapp && reboot` to restore the previous version. 3. Manually force the update using the method outlined above. 4. Reflash the system. ### If the Above Methods Do Not Resolve the Issue, Please Describe Your Model and Problems Encountered in the Forum, GitHub, or QQ Group. We Will Respond Patiently. + When providing feedback, please specify the version of your NanoKVM, the environment in which you are using it (motherboard model, system name, etc.), and the system configuration (e.g., image version 1.4.0; application version 2.2.5; H264; 1080P; high quality; frame rate 30).

Prepare the SD Card: The Full version comes with a 32G SD card. You will need to remove it by opening the case. The Lite version requires you to prepare an SD card of at least 8G. 1. Go to [Github](https://github.com/sipeed/NanoKVM/releases/latest) to download the latest version image. 1. Install the flashing software. We recommend using [Etcher](https://etcher.balena.io). 1. Run Etcher: ![run Ethcer](../../../../assets/NanoKVM/flashing/run_etcher.png) 1. Click `Flash from file` and select the image file: ![select image](../../../../assets/NanoKVM/flashing/select_image.png) 1. Click `Select target` and choose the SD card: ![select target](../../../../assets/NanoKVM/flashing/select_target.png) 1. Click `Flash!` to start the flashing process: ![select target](../../../../assets/NanoKVM/flashing/flashing.png) 1. Wait for the flashing process to complete. ![select target](../../../../assets/NanoKVM/flashing/flashed.png) Congratulations! The image has been successfully flashed! You can now insert the SD card into the NanoKVM and proceed to the next steps. ## USB Update TF Card Image **Note: Using USB can only update the system; it cannot be used for the initial flashing.** Please ensure that the TF card already has the system installed and **the system can run normally** before using this method. For **NanoKVM cube**: Power off the device, keeping the TF card inserted. Use a sharp object like a toothpick or SIM eject tool to press down on the reset button located in the small round hole next to the USB C port. While pressing down, connect the USB cable to the computer. Wait for the USB drive to appear on your computer, and once the `boot` drive icon shows up, you can release the tool. ![select target](../../../../assets\\NanoKVM\\flashing\\boot.png) Open `Etcher`, select the image file, choose the USB drive, and click `Flash`. ![select image](../../../../assets/NanoKVM/flashing/select_image.png) Wait for the flashing process to complete. If your computer prompts you with a message like `You need to format the disk in drive G: before you can use it`, **do not** format the disk! If you do, the newly flashed system will be erased. Simply close the window, right click the disk, and select \"Eject\" to safely remove the TF card. Then, disconnect the USB C cable, power the device back on, and wait for the system to boot. The first boot may take a little longer, so it's recommended to wait for about 1 minute (until something appears on the screen). Do not power off during boot, as doing so may corrupt system files being processed (the solution for such corruption is to re flash the image). > If you cannot enter USB upgrade mode, the system files may be corrupted. In this case, use a card reader to flash the TF card."},"/hardware/en/kvm/NanoKVM/system/updating.html":{"title":"Update Application","content":" title: Update Application keywords: NanoKVM, Remote desktop, Lichee, PiKVM, RISCV, tool update: date: 2024 8 13 version: v0.1 author: xwj content: Release docs ## Power On 1.

Please ensure it is not in use before trying again. + Linux may lack permissions to open the serial port. Execute `sudo chmod 777 /dev/ttyUSB*` in the terminal. + The Chrome browser may not have detected the serial port. Please refresh the webpage or restart Chrome. + Chrome may lack sufficient permissions. Please grant the necessary permissions. ### The serial port device cannot be found after connecting the device on the Mac Mini (Apple Silicon) This is typically because the rear Thunderbolt ports and the front USB ports on newer Mac Minis use different controllers, resulting in varying compatibility with certain USB devices. The rear Thunderbolt ports may be more selective when handling legacy USB serial devices (CDC ACM), while the native USB C ports on the front generally offer better compatibility. Recommended Solutions: + Use the front ports: Connect the device to the front USB C port on the Mac Mini. + Use a USB Hub: If you must use the rear ports, try connecting through a USB Hub, which usually resolves the detection issue. ## Video Issues ### Color Abnormalities in Loop Out/Capture on Some Host BIOS + Early firmware versions of the NanoKVM USB may cause the loop out image to appear reddish and the captured image to appear greenish on certain BIOS. This issue can be resolved by flashing a new firmware. Please download the flashing tool and firmware first: [Firmware Download Link](https://dl.sipeed.com/fileList/KVM/NanoKVM_USB/MS2131_LIB_V2_0_27_Demo_GPIO0_PlugDetect_20251205_replaced_E158EDID.bin), [Flashing Tool Download Link](https://dl.sipeed.com/fileList/KVM/NanoKVM_USB/MS_USB3_0_UpgradeTool_V1_3_2.exe) + Flashing Steps: 1. Open the flashing tool and select the downloaded firmware file. 2. Connect the USB C port on the NanoKVM USB host side to your computer. 3. Wait for the tool to detect the device, then click \"Start Flashing\" and wait for the process to complete. > **Do not disconnect the NanoKVM USB during the flashing process, as this may brick the device.** > The flashing tool only supports Windows. > Currently, flashing is not supported for the NanoKVM USB (4K) version. ### Poor Video Quality + First, check if you're using a USB 2.0 cable/HOST interface. When the resolution is high, USB 2.0 may not provide sufficient bandwidth, which can lower the video quality. It is recommended to use a USB 3.0 cable. + At 2K resolution, the video quality may decrease due to the chip's encoding capability. Please switch to 1080P. + If the target device is connected to a Windows host, go to System Settings > Display Settings > Advanced Display Settings, and change to 1080P60 in the \"List all modes\" section. Also, check if the \"Desktop Resolution\" and \"Active Signal Resolution\" are consistent. ### DP HDMI Adapter + Some passive DP to HDMI converters only perform level conversion in their internal circuitry, resulting in poor compatibility with NanoKVM USB. This manifests as the video signal not appearing when waking from sleep; the NanoKVM USB still shows a black screen, requiring manual unplugging and replugging of the HDMI cable. ### No HDMI Loop Out + The beta version hardware only supports USB power from the HOST side. Please ensure proper power supply from the HOST side during use. ### Loop Out Display + The NanoKVM USB uses its own EDID (Extended Display Identification Data) before connecting to the loop out display. After connecting to the loop out display, it switches to the EDID of the loop out display. + Since the EDID contains information about the display manufacturer and color settings, the resolution list in the Target system settings may appear different before and after connecting the loop out display. Additionally, the color of the video captured via USB may vary before and after the connection. ## Other + If the above methods do not resolve the issue, please describe your purchased model and the encountered problem on the forum, GitHub, or QQ group, and we will respond patiently. ## Known Issues ### Latency + The ARM version of macOS experiences increased latency when connected to a Raspberry Pi via NanoKVM USB; other combinations are not affected. ## Feedback Methods + [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/sipeed/NanoKVM) + [MaixHub Forum](https://maixhub.com/discussion/nanokvm) + QQ Group: 703230713"},"/hardware/en/kvm/NanoKVM_PCIe/introduction.html":{"title":"Introduction","content":" title: Introduction keywords: NanoKVM, Remote desktop, Lichee, PiKVM, RISCV, tool, PCIe update: date: 2024/12/11 version: v0.1 author: BuGu content: Release docs ## Introduction ![](./../../../assets/NanoKVM/introduce/NanoKVM PCIe.png) NanoKVM PCIe is a new form of NanoKVM, featuring a built in PCIe bracket that can be securely installed inside a chassis, providing a better experience for desktop users.

The main unit features Dupont jumpers (2+4P) and an SMA antenna socket. Note: The image above shows the NanoKVM PCIe version with WiFi and PoE. The version without WiFi will have one less antenna and will be missing the SMA antenna socket on the bracket. ## Interface Introduction ![](./../../../assets/NanoKVM/unbox/PCIe_new_interface.jpg) The two USB C ports on the old version of the beta hardware are reversed. Please refer to the diagram, and follow the labels on the backplate once you receive it. ![](./../../../assets/NanoKVM/unbox/PCIe Interface1.png) ![](./../../../assets/NanoKVM/unbox/PCIe Interface2.png) ## Power Supply + NanoKVM PCIe offers multiple power supply options: USB HID direct power, USB PWR IN auxiliary power, power from the PCIe slot, and PoE power (optional). You can choose any one of these options. Having multiple power sources will not interfere with the operation of the NanoKVM PCIe, but at least one power supply must be used. Note: If you need USB HID direct power, you must enable the \"Always Power USB\" setting in the BIOS, otherwise, it will affect the remote power on functionality. Note: The USB PWR IN CC interface of the NanoKVM PCIe has a 5.1K pull down resistor, allowing it to be powered by a standard PD charger. Some low quality PD chargers may pose a risk of damaging the NanoKVM PCIe. ## Assembly 1. The wiring for NanoKVM PCIe is similar to that of the Cube. Please install the NanoKVM PCIe while the main unit is powered off and disconnected from power. Only after testing all functions as normal should you install it into the case. > ❗ Please ensure that the buttons of NanoKVM PCIe can be pressed and released normally after installation into the PCIe slot; otherwise, it may prevent the NanoKVM from starting up or cause functional abnormalities. 2. Use a USB C to A data cable to connect the remote host to the USB HID interface of the NanoKVM (located below the HDMI interface) You can also connect directly to the nine pin USB 2.0 inside the case, as shown in the diagram below. ![](./../../../assets/NanoKVM/unbox/PCIe USB.jpg) When connecting, be sure to refer to the diagram above and the internal interface diagram of the NanoKVM PCIe below. Please check repeatedly before powering on; incorrect connections may risk damaging the NanoKVM! The silkscreen for \"HDD LED\" on the connection lines of some batches is incorrect. Please adjust according to the actual situation. ![](./../../../assets/NanoKVM/unbox/PCIe Pin.jpg) 3. Use the included HDMI cable to connect the remote host to the HDMI interface of the NanoKVM. 4. Use an Ethernet cable to connect the router/switch to the NanoKVM. If you ordered the WiFi version of NanoKVM PCIe after 24/12/07, this step can be skipped. Refer to the WiFi configuration section for connecting via WiFi. 5. ATX Power Control: The principle of remote control of the main power supply is to simulate the action of pressing the power button and read the LED status to synchronize with the webpage. For this, you need to disconnect the nine pin connector on the motherboard that was originally connected to the case power button and connect it to the corresponding interface on the NanoKVM PCIe. Additionally, to allow the case button to still control the power, you need to connect the power wiring from the case to the NanoKVM PCIe. ![](./../../../assets/NanoKVM/unbox/PCIE ATX.jpg) When wiring, please be sure to refer to the diagram above and the internal interface diagram of the NanoKVM PCIe. ![](./../../../assets/NanoKVM/unbox/PCIe Pin.jpg) Note: NanoKVM PCIe does not monitor HDD status. Note: Some early users of the NanoKVM PCIe with a full height PCIe bracket may encounter issues related to the installation being too long. Please use longer screws to secure it (be careful not to overtighten) or purchase washers with specifications of outer diameter 7mm, inner diameter 4.2mm, height 3mm. If you still encounter difficulties with the installation, please contact Taobao/AliExpress customer service or email support@sipeed.com for support. ## WiFi Configuration + This step is only applicable to the NanoKVM PCIe version with WiFi; other versions will display \" \" in the WiFi icon position. + If you are unable to connect an Ethernet cable, NanoKVM PCIe provides an AP configuration function. Connect your phone to the AP created by NanoKVM > enter the web configuration. The specific steps are as follows: 1. Power on the device and wait for the main UI to appear. The current WiFi status will not be lit, indicating no WiFi IP. ![](./../../../assets/NanoKVM/unbox/wifi0.jpg) 2. Use the included small screwdriver to press and hold the BOOT button in the PCIe panel for more than 2 seconds. ![](./../../../assets/NanoKVM/unbox/wifi1.jpg) 3. Wait for the WiFi AP QR code to appear, then scan the code to connect to the AP. ![](./../../../assets/NanoKVM/unbox/wifi2.jpg) ![](./../../../assets/NanoKVM/unbox/wifi3.jpg) 4. Once your phone is successfully connected, a web QR code will appear on the OLED display. Scan the code to automatically redirect to the configuration page. ![](./../../../assets/NanoKVM/unbox/wifi5.jpg) ![](./../../../assets/NanoKVM/unbox/wifi6.jpg) 5. Enter the WiFi account (SSID) and password for the NanoKVM PCIe, then click OK to complete the configuration. ![](./../../../assets/NanoKVM/unbox/wifi8.jpg) ![](./../../../assets/NanoKVM/unbox/wifi9.jpg) Note: + If you cannot connect to the AP via the QR code, you can short press the BOOT button. The OLED will display the AP SSID and password, which can be used to connect through your phone's system settings. + If you cannot open the webpage via the QR code, you can short press the BOOT button, and the OLED will display the WiFi configuration address. Enter this address in your phone's browser to configure. ![](./../../../assets/NanoKVM/unbox/wifi7.jpg) + If you cannot open the configuration webpage, please turn off mobile data and try again. + If the WiFi account or password is set incorrectly, the OLED will return to step 3. Please reconnect to the AP for configuration. + Long pressing the BOOT button will exit the WiFi configuration interface. + For security reasons, a random AP password will be generated each time you configure WiFi. It is recommended to follow the above steps to complete the configuration. ## Updates ### Update Application New applications often bring more features or fix important bugs. It is recommended to update NanoKVM applications to the latest version. For detailed instructions, please refer to [Updating Application](https://wiki.sipeed.com/hardware/zh/kvm/NanoKVM/system/updating.html). The update records for version 2.1.1 and subsequent versions can be found here: [Application Update Log](https://github.com/sipeed/NanoKVM/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md). ## Basic Operations ### How to Obtain an IP Address The PCIe version of NanoKVM comes with an OLED display, which will show the IP address after connecting to the network. For the WiFi version of NanoKVM PCIe, the IP addresses obtained via ETH and WiFi will alternate on the display. The IP address with an 'E' prefix is the ETH IP, while the one with a 'W' prefix is the IP obtained via WiFi. ![](./../../../assets/NanoKVM/unbox/wifi9.jpg) ### Viewing Remote Desktop Enter the obtained IP directly in your browser to access the login page. The default username and password are both admin. After logging in, it is recommended to change your password and [update](https://wiki.sipeed.com/hardware/zh/kvm/NanoKVM/system/updating.html) to the latest applications. ![](./../../../assets/NanoKVM/unbox/frist_update.png) **Note:** It is recommended to use the Chrome browser, as other browsers may experience compatibility issues such as inability to display the screen or operate the keyboard and mouse. **Note:** In some versions, there may be issues accessing the web interface or crashes after login. Please disconnect the HDMI interface, power cycle the device, update to the latest application, and then reconnect the HDMI. ### ATX Power Control If the power control interface is connected, you can remotely control the computer's power on from the web page. + The web interface provides power status indicators and functions for the power and reset buttons, but it cannot monitor the HDD activity light status."},"/hardware/en/kvm/NanoKVM_PCIe/user_guide.html":{"title":"User Guide","content":" title: User Guide keywords: NanoKVM, Remote desktop, Lichee, PiKVM, RISCV, tool update: date: 2024/12/10 version: v0.1 author: BuGu content: Release docs ## OLED Interface On the NanoKVM PCIe, the OLED has two interfaces: the main interface and the WiFi configuration interface, which can be switched by long pressing the BOOT button for 2 seconds. **Main Interface:** ![](./../../../assets/NanoKVM/unbox/wifi9.jpg) + Displays the connection status for Ethernet, USB, and HDMI. The icons will change to an inverted color when connected. + IP: After connecting the Ethernet, the NanoKVM will automatically obtain an IP address and display it on the OLED. The WiFi version will automatically switch the IP. + Resolution: Displays the physical resolution of the HDMI, such as 1920x1080. + FPS: Shows the real time transmission frame rate. + The main interface provides an OLED sleep function to prevent screen burn in. You can short press the BOOT button to turn the OLED off or on. + After applying version `2.1.4`, the OLED automatic sleep feature has been added: After setting the sleep time in the settings, the OLED will automatically enter sleep mode after the set time. Pressing the BOOT button can temporarily wake up the OLED. **WiFi Configuration Interface** (not available for versions without WiFi): ![](./../../../assets/NanoKVM/unbox/wifi2.jpg) + Sequentially displays the WiFi configuration process: Creating WiFi AP > WiFi QR code > Web QR code. + After a successful WiFi connection, it will automatically exit this interface. + For detailed WiFi configuration steps, please refer to [Configuring WiFi](https://wiki.sipeed.com/hardware/zh/kvm/NanoKVM_PCIe/quick_start.html#WiFi 配网). ## Management Page Functions ![](./../../../assets/NanoKVM/introduce/web_ui.gif) The floating toolbar from left to right includes: image settings, on screen keyboard, mouse style, image mounting, custom scripts, KVM web terminal, WOL, ATX control/indicator, settings, full screen, and hide floating toolbar. ### Resolution, Format, Frame Rate, and Image Quality Settings + NanoKVM supports image transmission at 1080P, 720P, 600P, and 480P resolutions. You can select different resolutions in the image settings under \"Resolution.\" Higher resolutions require more bandwidth and result in lower real time frame rates. In Auto mode, the transmission resolution will follow the physical resolution of the host's HDMI. + Note: This only modifies the size of the transmitted image and does not change the size of the HDMI input image. For adjustments, please go to the host system's settings menu. + Format Settings: Currently, NanoKVM supports two formats: MJPEG and H264. + MJPEG format transmits each frame of the image, offering relatively high image quality with predictable latency, but it consumes more bandwidth. + H264 format transmits video stream data, resulting in smaller data size and lower latency, especially noticeable at high quality. + The frame rate setting option allows you to modify the maximum frame rate of the transmission. This can help limit network bandwidth usage, but lower frame rates may result in choppy images. Please configure this based on your network conditions. Full version users can see the real time video frame rate on the OLED. + The image quality option modifies the compression ratio of the image. If you find the image choppy or experiencing high latency, you can lower the image quality. + In MJPEG format, low, medium, high, and lossless correspond to image compression ratios of 50%, 60%, 80%, and 100%, respectively. + In H264 format, low, medium, high, and lossless correspond to transmission bit rates of 1000Kbps, 2000Kbps, 3000Kbps, and 5000Kbps, respectively. ### Virtual Keyboard and Mouse Usage + The USB interface of NanoKVM simulates keyboard and mouse devices. Once you open the browser page, the system will automatically capture keyboard and mouse inputs and synchronize the actions in real time to the host connected to NanoKVM. Users can choose to hide the mouse or change its display style on the screen. + For users who find it inconvenient to use a keyboard, we provide an on screen keyboard that can be accessed by clicking the keyboard icon in the floating toolbar. + In rare cases, the HID keyboard and mouse may not control the host. Please click \"Reset HID\" and try again. + Some BIOS require the mouse to operate in relative movement mode. Please modify this in the web interface under \"Mouse Mode.\" + Some BIOS require the keyboard and mouse to operate in a mode with the BIOS mark. Please execute `/touch /boot/BIOS && reboot` in the web terminal. ### ISO Image Mounting and Remote Installation + The USB C port of Nano KVM not only simulates keyboard and mouse devices but also simulates a USB drive, mounting a portion of the TF card's storage space for installation purposes. This USB drive is formatted as exFAT by default, and the Full version of NanoKVM has a built in TF card with a simulated USB drive size of approximately 21GB. + Unlike a regular USB drive, the virtual USB drive of NanoKVM can store multiple images simultaneously. Before booting, you can select the system image to mount via the web page options. Users need to download the desired installation image (usually ending with .iso) in advance, insert the NanoKVM USB C into the computer, and copy the downloaded image directly to the USB drive (multiple systems can be copied). You can then safely remove it. Follow the steps above to connect the remote host with Nano KVM. After logging into the system via the browser, click the disk icon and select the system to be installed to achieve ISO mounting. ![](./../../../assets/NanoKVM/guide/imgsl.png) Next, start the installation process by clicking Power On, then quickly press the F11 key on the keyboard (the key may vary depending on the host, please refer to the host's documentation). Select the corresponding image to boot and complete the installation process. ![](./../../../assets/NanoKVM/guide/install.png) Note: + The virtual USB drive function is enabled by default. If not needed, it can be disabled by clicking `Settings` > `Virtual USB Drive`. + Please safely eject the existing 21GB virtual USB drive on the host before mounting the image to avoid data loss. + The virtual USB drive can also be used as a regular USB drive. When no image is selected on the web interface, the entire 21GB virtual USB drive is mounted by default. + Users can also use the conventional method to burn the image onto a card, but this is not recommended. + The speed of copying images into NanoKVM is limited by the USB 2.0 transfer speed and SG2002 card writing speed, which may be relatively slow. Users can remove the TF card, insert it into a computer, and [unhide](https://jingyan.baidu.com/article/e4511cf34faece2b845eaf34.html) the third partition of the TF card to directly copy the image into it. + The virtual USB drive is also mounted to the NanoKVM’s `/data` directory, allowing users to read and write directly to that partition within the NanoKVM terminal. + Canceling the virtual USB drive operation in the settings will forcibly eject the USB drive. Please safely eject the USB drive first before making changes to avoid data loss. ### Web Terminal + Users can open the web terminal by clicking the `Terminal` > `NanoKVM Terminal` icon in the floating toolbar, allowing direct access to the NanoKVM system without needing SSH. + When the NanoKVM disconnects and reconnects to the network or after a system restart, the web terminal interface will prompt for re login, with the username `root` and password `root`. ![](./../../../assets/NanoKVM/guide/ssh.png) ### Serial Terminal NanoKVM is built on the LicheeRV Nano platform, which has a total of three serial ports. UART0 is used by default for outputting system logs. In the NanoKVM Full version, UART1 and UART2 are also available for users to expand functionality (the first batch of beta versions only has openings on the casing). ![](./../../../assets/NanoKVM/guide/uart_to_3H.jpg) Click on `Terminal` in the management page, select `Serial Terminal`, choose the serial port you want to use, enter the baud rate, and click Start to begin using it. ![](./../../../assets/NanoKVM/guide/uart1.png) ![](./../../../assets/NanoKVM/guide/uart2.png) Note: The serial terminal function is built using WebSSH and picocom, and its usage is the same as that of picocom. ### RNDIS The USB of NanoKVM will default to virtualizing an RNDIS USB network card (as a device). This can be used for system maintenance when the NanoKVM service is abnormal. Please refer to [here](https://wiki.sipeed.com/hardware/zh/kvm/NanoKVM/system/updating.html#%E9%80%9A%E8%BF%87 usb rndis %E7%BD%91%E5%8F%A3%E8%8E%B7%E5%8F%96) for connecting to a computer, and feel free to explore more uses. If you do not wish to use the RNDIS function, you can click `Settings` > `RNDIS` to disable it. Note: The NCM connection method was added after version 2.1.5, but the default remains RNDIS. To enable it, use: touch /boot/usb.ncm or create an empty file named usb.ncm in the /boot partition. ### ATX Power Control + On the right side of the floating toolbar, there are power and hard drive icons. Under normal circumstances, they are gray; after powering on, the power icon turns green. + Clicking the power icon shows the restart button and power button (long/short press). + The ATX control board for the Full version is limited by the number of pins in the extension cable, only allowing for the power, restart button, and power indicator to be connected. It is normal for the hard drive light not to be illuminated. ### Settings + Switch between Chinese and English. + About NanoKVM: Click to open the Wiki. + Check for updates: When updates are available, users can click to update. After about 15 seconds, the webpage will automatically refresh and re login to complete the update. + Version 2.2.5 introduces a preview update feature. Enable this option to pull the latest preview version. Note: Preview applications generally include feature updates, bug fixes, and performance improvements, but there is still a chance of introducing new bugs. Please update with caution. ### About SSH + In version 2.1.6 and later, SSH can be enabled or permanently disabled through the web interface. You can do this in **Settings > Devices > SSH**. + In version 1.4.0 and later, SSH is disabled by default. 1. **Permanently Disable:** Execute `touch /etc/kvm/ssh_stop` to disable SSH login on the next boot of NanoKVM. To enable it again, delete the file using `rm /etc/kvm/ssh_stop`. 2. **Temporarily Enable:** Execute `touch /boot/start_ssh_once` or create an empty file named `start_ssh_once` in the /boot partition. This will enable SSH on the next boot of NanoKVM, and the file will be automatically deleted. ### Setting DNS + If you need to set a DNS list, create `/boot/resolv.conf`. This will enforce your own DNS configuration after booting. ### About mDNS + mDNS (Multicast DNS) is a protocol used for name resolution within a local network, allowing devices to discover and communicate with each other using hostnames instead of IP addresses, without needing a central DNS server. + NanoKVM generates mDNS hostnames based on the device code to minimize conflicts when multiple devices are present. + The device name for NanoKVM can be modified in the settings and will take effect after a restart. + mDNS services can lead to higher CPU usage in complex network environments, affecting image smoothness. It is recommended to disable it when not in use: **Settings > Devices > mDNS**. ### About the Watchdog + The watchdog system was added in version 2.2.2 to continuously monitor the server service. If the service encounters an exception, the system will restart. By default, it is disabled. You can enable it by executing `touch /etc/kvm/watchdog` in the web terminal and disable it with `rm /etc/kvm/watchdog`. ### More Features Coming Soon! ## Hardware and Structure The NanoKVM PCIe consists of two parts: the mainboard and the USB interface board, connected via a 2P+4P ribbon cable. The USB interface board only exposes the USB HID and USB PWR interfaces. When the USB HID needs to connect to the internal pins of the mainboard, the 4P ribbon cable can be disconnected. The PCIe full height bracket is secured to the mainboard with two screws. To replace it with a half height bracket, please unscrew the screws and replace it. Due to the positioning of interfaces in PCIe specifications, the HDMI and lower USB ports are relatively close together. Some HDMI connectors may be thick and could interfere with the USB interface.

Q: How to check the SDK version of the current system? A: Run the command `cat /proc/ax_proc/version`. Example output: ```bash root@ax650:~# cat /proc/ax_proc/version Ax_Version V1.45.0_P39_20240830020829 ``` ## Q: After updating to v1.45.0_P39, the root filesystem is smaller than 5GB. How to expand it? A: Before expansion: ```bash root@ax650:~# df h Filesystem Size Used Avail Use% Mounted on /dev/root 4.9G 4.3G 336M 93% / ``` After expansion: ```bash root@ax650:~# df h Filesystem Size Used Avail Use% Mounted on /dev/root 15G 4.3G 9.6G 31% / ``` Steps: 1. Identify whether the system boots from TFCard or eMMC: ```bash root@ax650:~# grep oP 'root \\K\\S+' /proc/cmdline /dev/mmcblk1p2 # TFCard 启动 # /dev/mmcblk0p2 # 或 eMMC 启动 ``` 2. Replace `/dev/mmcblkX` in the following commands with the detected device (e.g., `/dev/mmcblk0` or `/dev/mmcblk1`), then execute: ```bash parted /dev/mmcblkX resizepart 2 100% resize2fs /dev/mmcblkXp2 fsck y /dev/mmcblkXp2 sync ``` Q: After updating to v1.45, the root filesystem only shows 8GB. How to fix this? A: This occurs when booting after the first flash. The eMMC partition is pre configured for maximum capacity. Run the following to update filesystem metadata (post expansion size should be 28GB): ```bash resize2fs /dev/mmcblk0p10 fsck y /dev/mmcblkXp10 sync # Critical! Prevents boot failure after power cycle. ``` Expected result: ```bash root@maixbox:~# df h Filesystem Size Used Avail Use% Mounted on /dev/root 28G 6.0G 21G 23% / ``` Warning: Always run `sync` before rebooting/power off to avoid system corruption. ## Q: How to resolve network conflicts caused by duplicate MAC addresses? A: Permanently modify MAC addresses via U Boot environment variables: ```bash # 例如 setenv ethaddr d0:00:00:00:00:01 setenv eth1addr d0:00:00:00:00:02 saveenv ``` ## Key Notes: For eMMC operations, ensure sync is executed to prevent data loss. MAC address changes require saveenv to persist across reboots. Refer to official docs for advanced partitioning scenarios."},"/hardware/en/maixIV/m4cdock/quick-start.html":{"title":"","content":"## System Boot and Login **Note:** The system must be powered via 12V DC input. USB power alone may cause insufficient power supply leading to system instability. ### Pre Boot Preparation Required: 1. 12V DC power supply 2. HDMI cable and display 3. Type C cable (optional: for serial debugging/login) 4. RJ45 Ethernet cable (optional: for network connection and SSH login) For first time use, verify the following status matches your hardware version: Power switch on enclosure is ON (for enclosed versions) Jumper cap remains shorted at Button marking (for bare board versions) ![top](../../../zh/maixIV/assets/top.png) ### Normal Boot Connect display via HDMI1 and provide 12V DC power. After approximately 20 seconds, the LightDM login interface will appear, indicating successful system boot. ![desktop](../../../zh/maixIV/assets/desktop.jpg) Connect mouse/keyboard to the onboard USB A port for operation. Use default credentials (username: `root`, password: `root`) to access the Debian desktop system. ### Advanced: Serial & SSH Login The onboard Type C USB port serves as the default debug UART (**115200 8n1**). Use a serial tool to view kernel logs or log in directly via terminal. For SSH access, expand network connectivity via USB Ethernet/WiFi dongles. Note: The system only has the root superuser, and SSH password login is disabled by default for security. For temporary access, refer to [here](../m4c/FAQ.html)。 ## Interactive Image Segmentation & Inpainting A QT based GUI for real time segmentation (point/box selection) and inpainting. ![samqt](../../../zh/maixIV/assets/samqt.jpg) Open Source Official GitHub Repo: [SAM ONNX AX650 CPP](https://github.com/AXERA TECH/SAM ONNX AX650 CPP) Download prebuilt binaries or compile from source.

Linux users can use the xz tool, while Windows users can use tools like 7 zip. ![](../../../zh/maixIV/assets/baidupan dl.png) ## Booting and Flashing eMMC via TFCard ### Booting into the Live System (Manual Intervention Required) #### Step 1: Prepare TFCard and Flash the Image Prepare a TFCard with at least 8GB capacity and use any card reader tool or the computer's built in card slot for reading/writing. Note: The following operations will erase all data on the TFCard. Back up important data beforehand. HOST OS Flashing Method Linux `sudo dd if sdcard.img of /dev/sdX bs 4M conv fsync status progress` Windows Use `Win32DiskImager`, `Rufus` or `balenaEtcher` to flash the image Example for Linux: ```bash # Assuming the TFCard is mounted as /dev/sdb % sudo dd if sdcard.img of /dev/sdb bs 4G conv sparse,fsync status progress 0+3 records in 0+3 records out 5754429440 bytes (5.8 GB, 5.4 GiB) copied, 89.2665 s, 64.5 MB/s ``` #### Step 2: Booting into the Live System Using the Flashed TFCard **TFCard Boot Method** Board Device Tree Blob TF Card Slot Location `BOOT` Button Location Dock `dtbs/m4nbox.dtb` Top left corner, diagonal to Type C port Next to Type C port (labeled BOOT) Hat `dtbs/m4nhat.dtb` Behind USB3 port, near the notch Next to HDMI port (labeled BOOT0) Cluster `dtbs/m4ncluster.dtb` Below M.2 slot Next to Type C port (labeled BOOT) 1. Mount the TFCard and modify the `dtb_img_name dtbs/m4nbox.dtb` line in the FAT32 partition's `config.txt` file to match your board. 2. Insert the TFCard into the TF card slot. 3. Hold the `BOOT` button and reset the board: Option 1: Power cycle (unplug and replug power). Option 2: Press and release the `RST` button while powered on. Note for M4C Dock: If the front panel is obstructed, remove it by unscrewing the 3 screws and rotating it open. After completing these steps, the Live system should boot. You can observe the boot logs via UART0. **This Live system is fully functional and ready for immediate use. If you want the system to boot automatically without manual button operations, proceed to flash the image to eMMC as described below.** ### Flashing eMMC from the Live System (Automatic Boot on Power Up) The onboard eMMC is always recognized as `/dev/mmcblk0`, while the TFCard is `/dev/mmcblk1`. Be careful to distinguish between them. There are two methods are provided below for flashing the image to eMMC: #### Method 1: Directly Recovery from the Live System 1. Boot into the Live system as described earlier and open a terminal for the following steps. 2. Use `dd` to **recovery** the Live system from the TFCard to eMMC: ```sh dd if /dev/mmcblk1 of /dev/mmcblk0 bs 3M count 1 conv fsync sync # 确保分区表生效 dd if /dev/mmcblk1p1 of /dev/mmcblk0p1 bs 64M conv fsync dd if /dev/mmcblk1p2 of /dev/mmcblk0p2 bs 1G conv sparse,fsync status progress fsck y /dev/mmcblk0p2 sync ``` 3. After completion, remove the TFCard. Just press the `RST` button and the system will now directly boot from eMMC. #### Method 2: Flash the Image within the Live System Prerequisite: The second partition (ext4) of the TFCard must be accessible and writable. If unsure, use Method 1. 1. Copy the sdcard.img file to any location in the second partition (Live system root directory). 2. Flash the image to eMMC: ```sh dd if /path/to/sdcard.img of /dev/mmcblk0 bs 1G conv sparse,fsync status progress ``` 3. After completion, remove the TFCard. Just press the `RST` button and the system will now directly boot from eMMC. ## Flashing via AXDL Software The flashing file format has changed to be like `xxx.axp`. For detailed steps, refer to the `AXDL 工具使用指南.pdf` in the official SDK documentation package. **Tip: The Download button on the official EVB corresponds to the BOOT button on other boards.** The AXDL software (Windows only) is located in the `PC_Software` directory on the download site. **Important Notes for M4C Dock:** **The USB flashing port is the bottom `USB A port` near the `HDMI` connector (Ethernet side). Use an `A to A` cable or `A to C` cable if your PC has a `Type C port`.** **Do `not` connect the `12V power supply` during flashing. Use only the USB cable to avoid damaging the `PC's USB port`.**"},"/hardware/en/maixIV/m4c/FAQ.html":{"title":"","content":"## How to enable root user password login for SSH when the correct password is entered but login fails? Default password: root *For security reasons, the default policy only allows the root user to log in remotely via SSH key authentication, which is not only convenient and fast but also secure. The required steps are as follows: After logging into the system via serial port or desktop, manually paste your public key into the `/root/.ssh/authorized_keys` file (create the file if it does not exist). For a more detailed process, you can search for \"SSH login with key\" or refer directly to this [tutorial](https://www.runoob.com/w3cnote/set ssh login key.html)。* If you insist on enabling password login, follow these steps: ```bash # Log in via the serial terminal and execute the following commands: # Enable remote password login for the root user echo \"PermitRootLogin yes\" > /etc/ssh/sshd_config.d/allow root.conf systemctl restart sshd ``` After development, to avoid risks caused by accidental root password leakage, it is recommended to disable remote password login for the root user by executing the following commands: ```bash # Log in to any terminal and execute the following commands: # Disable remote password login for the root user rm /etc/ssh/sshd_config.d/allow root.conf systemctl restart sshd ``` ## Q: The root filesystem partition is too small by default when using TFCard & eMMC images. How to expand eMMC or TFCard? ```bash # Log in to any terminal and execute the following commands: # Replace mmcblkX below with mmcblk0 (eMMC) or mmcblk1 (TFCard). # /dev/mmcblkXp2 is the second partition, which is the root filesystem partition. parted /dev/mmcblkX resizepart 2 100% resize2fs /dev/mmcblkXp2 fsck y /dev/mmcblkXp2 sync ``` ## Q: Some large language models require executing tokenizer related Python scripts, but an error \"ModuleNotFoundError\" occurs. How to resolve this? ```bash # To avoid polluting the system Python libraries, create a virtual environment: apt install python3 venv python3 m venv venv llm # Activate the virtual environment: source venv llm/bin/activate # Install the missing Python modules (use Tsinghua Mirror for faster installation in China): pip install transformers jinja2 i https://mirrors.tuna.tsinghua.edu.cn/pypi/web/simple # After installation, you can proceed to execute the script. ``` Remember to activate the virtual environment before running related Python scripts each time: ```bash # Activate the virtual environment: source venv llm/bin/activate ``` ## Q: If GPIO2_A27 is configured as I2C3_SCL in the device tree, how can I control GPIO2_A27 when I2C3 is not in use? (pinctrl) ```bash cd /sys/kernel/debug/pinctrl/4250200.pinctrl grep \"GPIO2_A27\" pinmux functions # output # function 447: GPIO2_A27, groups [ I2C3_SCL ] grep \"I2C3_SCL\" pinmux pins # output # pin 87 (I2C3_SCL): device 2024000.i2c function i2c3_scl group I2C3_SCL echo 2024000.i2c > /sys/bus/platform/drivers/i2c_designware/unbind grep \"I2C3_SCL\" pinmux pins # output # pin 87 (I2C3_SCL): UNCLAIMED # echo \"<group name function name>\" > pinmux select echo \"I2C3_SCL GPIO2_A27\" > pinmux select gpioset gpiochip2 27 0 gpioset gpiochip2 27 1 ``` ## Q: The MAC physical address is randomly generated upon each reboot, causing unstable IP addresses. How can this be resolved? A: Starting from sdcard 20250627.img.xz, the `config.txt` file in the root directory of the first partition (FAT32) contains the U Boot environment variable configuration. To permanently modify the MAC addresses of the corresponding network interfaces, add the environment variables `ethaddr` and `eth1addr` like this below: ``` ethaddr d0:00:00:00:00:03 eth1addr d0:00:00:00:00:04 ``` ![](../../../zh/maixIV/assets/m4c/set macaddress.png)"},"/hardware/en/maixIV/m4c/axmodel-deploy.html":{"title":"Deploying AI Models on M4C","content":"# Deploying AI Models on M4C ## Deploying Large Language and Multimodal Models Obtain models and runtime environments from the following sources.

Run `sudo raspi config → 6 Advanced Options → A8 PCIe Speed → Select Yes` for PCIe x1 Gen3. 5.1.or Manually add contents below to `/boot/firmware/config.txt`: ```bash [all] dtparam pciex1_gen 3 ``` Actually the `config.txt` file is located in the FAT32 type partition, so you can modify it after mount it on your PC directly. > Note: Newly flashed Raspberry Pi SD cards lack the /boot/firmware directory. Boot once to generate it. 6. Reboot Raspberry Pi. Verify the accelerator card is detected with `lspci`: ```bash sipeed@rpi sipeed:~$ lspci 0001:00:00.0 PCI bridge: Broadcom Inc. and subsidiaries BCM2712 PCIe Bridge (rev 21) 0001:01:00.0 Multimedia video controller: Axera Semiconductor Co., Ltd Device 0650 (rev01) 0002:00:00.0 PCI bridge: Broadcom Inc. and subsidiaries BCM2712 PCIe Bridge (rev 21) 0002:01:00.0 Ethernet controller: Raspberry Pi Ltd RP1 PCIe 2.0 South Bridge ``` The first two lines confirm PCIe initialization and detection of the Axera AX650 controller. ANd the `Multimedia video controller: Axera Semiconductor Co., Ltd Device 0650 (rev01)` has been mounted correctly. ### Installing AXCL Software on Raspberry Pi 5 You can download it separately to the Raspberry Pi development board from the download site, or directly use the provided AIDemos.tar.zst below. After PCIe detection, install the AXCL package for model acceleration: ```bash $ sudo apt install axcl_host_aarch64_V3.6.2_20250603154858_NO4873.deb # If your PCIe device is detected (visible in lspci), but axcl smi fails to display it, follow these steps to reinstall the driver: sudo apt install reinstall axcl_host_aarch64_V3.6.2_20250603154858_NO4873.deb ``` Reboot the Pi. Verify installation with `axcl smi`: ```bash sipeed@rpi sipeed:~$ axcl smi + + AXCL SMI V3.6.2_20250603154858 Driver V3.6.2_20250603154858 + + + + Card Name Firmware Bus Id Memory Usage Fan Temp Pwr:Usage/Cap CPU NPU CMM Usage + + 0 AX650N V3.6.2 0001:01:00.0 148 MiB / 945 MiB 55C / 0% 0% 18 MiB / 7040 MiB + + + + + + Processes: Card PID Process Name NPU Memory Usage ``` ## Model Demonstration Guide Download [AIDemos.tar.zst](https://mega.nz/folder/NxxEzRAB#e sA_IK0K5JqQM6FnCH6_Q) from the cloud storage and extract it to reproduce and experience the following deployed models. ### Preparation: Prepare the Python environment and install the `axengine` package. ```bash cd /path/to/AIDemos/extra python m venv venv llm source venv llm/bin/activate pip install r requirements.txt pip install axengine 0.1.3 py3 none any.whl ``` Result: ```bash sipeed@rpi sipeed:~/Downloads/AIDemos/extra $ ls lh total 44M rw r r 1 sipeed sipeed 44M Aug 14 09:04 axcl_host_aarch64_V3.6.2_20250603154858_NO4873.deb rw r r 1 sipeed sipeed 19K Aug 14 09:46 axengine 0.1.3 py3 none any.whl rw r r 1 sipeed sipeed 1.3K Aug 18 08:50 requirements.txt drwxr xr x 6 sipeed sipeed 4.0K Aug 18 03:24 venv llm ``` ### YOLO11 Link: https://huggingface.co/AXERA TECH/YOLO11 Preparation: ```bash source ../extra/venv llm/bin/activate ``` Example: ```bash sipeed@rpi sipeed:~/Downloads/AIDemos/YOLO11 $ ls axcl_yolo11 ax_yolo11\tfootball.jpg ssd_horse.jpg yolo11s.axmodel yolo11x.axmodel sipeed@rpi sipeed:~/Downloads/AIDemos/YOLO11 $ ./axcl_yolo11 m yolo11s.axmodel i football.jpg model file : yolo11s.axmodel image file : football.jpg img_h, img_w : 640 640 axclrtEngineCreateContextt is done. axclrtEngineGetIOInfo is done. grpid: 0 input size: 1 name: images 1 x 640 x 640 x 3 output size: 3 name: /model.23/Concat_output_0 1 x 80 x 80 x 144 name: /model.23/Concat_1_output_0 1 x 40 x 40 x 144 name: /model.23/Concat_2_output_0 1 x 20 x 20 x 144 Engine push input is done. post process cost time:0.90 ms Repeat 1 times, avg time 3.34 ms, max_time 3.34 ms, min_time 3.34 ms detection num: 7 0: 95%, [ 759, 213, 1126, 1152], person 0: 94%, [ 0, 359, 315, 1107], person 0: 94%, [1350, 344, 1629, 1036], person 0: 89%, [ 490, 480, 658, 996], person 32: 73%, [ 771, 888, 830, 939], sports ball 32: 67%, [1231, 876, 1280, 924], sports ball 0: 62%, [ 0, 565, 86, 995], person ``` <div style \"display: flex;

Configure channels, sample rate, sample points/time, and other parameters as needed. Use the software to trigger, acquire, browse, measure, decode protocols, and manage files. ### Changing the Sample Depth The sample depth determines how many data points are captured per acquisition. You can set the sample depth in the main control panel, typically as either a number of points. Higher sample depth allows capturing longer or more detailed signal traces, but requires more memory and may take longer to transfer. If you only need to capture short events, reduce the sample depth for faster operation. Adjust the sample depth before starting acquisition to fit your analysis needs. **Sample depth is unlimited if you have a large enough disk; data can be streamed directly to storage.** ![unlimited sample depth](../../../en/logic_analyzer/slogic16u3/assets/Screenshots/Screenshot_2025 09 25_16 53 25.png) ### Changing the Sample Rate **Max sample rate:** 800 MHz (depends on active channels) **16 channels:** up to 200 MHz **8 channels:** up to 400 MHz **4 channels:** up to 800 MHz Set the sample rate in the main control panel. If higher rates are unavailable, disable unused channels. ![200MHz max on 16ch](../../../en/logic_analyzer/slogic16u3/assets/Screenshots/Screenshot_2025 09 25_14 30 46.png) ![400MHz max on 8ch](../../../en/logic_analyzer/slogic16u3/assets/Screenshots/Screenshot_2025 09 25_14 31 04.png) ![800MHz max on 4ch](../../../en/logic_analyzer/slogic16u3/assets/Screenshots/Screenshot_2025 09 25_14 31 20.png) ### Selecting Active Channels Choose between **16**, **8**, or **4** channel configurations. Enable/disable channels in the configuration area. Fewer active channels allow higher sample rates. ![entry of channel selection](../../../en/logic_analyzer/slogic16u3/assets/Screenshots/Screenshot_2025 09 25_14 34 42.png) ![Channel count(pulseview modified)](../../../en/logic_analyzer/slogic16u3/assets/Screenshots/Screenshot_2025 09 25_14 35 03.png) ![Buffer size(default)](../../../en/logic_analyzer/slogic16u3/assets/Screenshots/Screenshot_2025 09 25_14 42 35.png) ### Adjusting Voltage Threshold Set threshold from **0.1V to 6.0V** in **0.1V steps**. Adjust in the channel/device configuration panel. Match threshold to your logic level (e.g., 1.0V for 3.3V CMOS). Apply changes before acquisition. ![entry of volt threshold selection](../../../en/logic_analyzer/slogic16u3/assets/Screenshots/Screenshot_2025 09 25_14 34 42.png) ![6V max](../../../en/logic_analyzer/slogic16u3/assets/Screenshots/Screenshot_2025 09 25_14 45 40.png) Tip: For 3.3V CMOS/TTL, set threshold to ~1.0V (30% of 3.3V). ### Edge Trigger Configure edge trigger to start capture on a specific signal transition. In the trigger panel, select channel and trigger type (rising, falling, or both). ![](../../../en/logic_analyzer/slogic16u3/assets/Screenshots/Screenshot_2025 09 25_15 05 54.png) ![](../../../en/logic_analyzer/slogic16u3/assets/Screenshots/Screenshot_2025 09 25_15 06 48.png) ## Build Software from Source The software is open source. [Sipeed's libsigrok GitHub Repository](https://github.com/sipeed/libsigrok/tree/slogic dev) **Recommended:** Use [sigrok util](https://github.com/sigrokproject/sigrok util) build scripts for a simple, cross platform experience. **Steps:** 1. Clone sigrok util and follow its README for dependencies. 2. Edit the build script to use Sipeed's libsigrok fork: ```bash $GIT_CLONE https://github.com/sipeed/libsigrok b slogic dev ``` 3. (Optional) Add options to speed up build and reduce size: ``` disable all drivers enable sipeed slogic analyzer disable bindings enable cxx ``` 4. Run the build script for your target (e.g., `./sigrok cross linux`, `./sigrok cross mingw`, `./sigrok cross macosx`). For advanced/manual builds, refer to upstream sigrok and PulseView documentation. ## Firmware Update Firmware updates are provided via a Python/PyQt GUI tool. [Firmware update tool repository](https://github.com/sipeed/slogic16u3 tools) **Update steps:** 1. Clone/download the repository: ```bash git clone https://github.com/sipeed/slogic16u3 tools.git ``` 2. Install dependencies and set up the environment: ```bash source .venv/bin/activate ``` 3. Navigate to the `pt` directory: ```bash cd pt ``` 4. Run the GUI tool: ```bash python src/gui.py ``` 5. Press the **mode** button on the device. The GUI should display \"SLogic16U3 OTA\". 6. Select the firmware file in the GUI. 7. Click **OTA** to start the update. 8. Wait for completion and follow on screen instructions. > **Note:** A binary version of the update tool will be released soon. ![](../../../en/logic_analyzer/slogic16u3/assets/Screenshots/Screenshot_2025 09 25_15 34 06.png) ## FAQ ### Why can't I find the SLogic16U3 device in Linux? Normal users can't access USB devices by default. Run Pulseview with `sudo`: ```bash sudo ./Pulseview.appimage ``` Or set up udev rules (see below). ### How do I set up udev rules for Linux? Create a new udev rules file: ```bash sudo tee /etc/udev/rules.d/60 sipeed.rules <<EOF SUBSYSTEM! \"usbusb_device\", GOTO \"sipeed_rules_end\" ACTION! \"add\", GOTO \"sipeed_rules_end\" ATTRS{idVendor} \"359f\", MODE \"0666\", GROUP \"plug_dev\", TAG+ \"uaccess\" ENV{ID_MM_DEVICE_IGNORE} \"1\" LABEL \"sipeed_rules_end\" EOF ``` Reload udev rules and trigger: ```bash sudo udevadm control reload sudo udevadm trigger ``` Unplug and reconnect the device. You can now run Pulseview as a normal user. ### Why can't I use higher sample rates? Only 200M shows. The maximum sample rate depends on the number of active channels and USB bandwidth. Slogic16U3's USB 3.0 provides up to ~400MB/s. To use higher rates (400M/800M), disable unused channels."},"/hardware/en/logic_analyzer/slogic16u3/FAQ.html":{"title":"FAQ","content":"# FAQ ## Why can't I find the SLogic16U3 device? ![No SLogic Device](./assets/Screenshots/Screenshot_2025 09 26_11 40 49.png) The most common reason is that PulseView was started before the SLogic16U3 was connected. If the software can't see a device at startup it may not probe for it again automatically. Solutions: 1. For automatic detection, connect the SLogic16U3 first, then launch PulseView. The software should auto detect the device on startup. 2. If you started the software before connecting the SLogic, manually open the \"Connect to Device\" (or \"Device Settings\") dialog after plugging the SLogic in: Open \"Connect to Device\". Choose the correct driver/back end for the SLogic16U3. Click \"Scan\" to discover attached devices. Select the SLogic device from the list and click \"OK\". The UI will return to the normal capture/home page and the device will be available. ![SLogic Found](./assets/Screenshots/Screenshot_2025 09 26_11 41 22.png) Additionally, on Linux a normal user cannot access USB devices by default due to permission restrictions. ![Nothing Found](./assets/Screenshots/Screenshot_2025 09 26_11 41 03.png) Choose one of the two methods below: Run PulseView with root privileges (quick test): ```bash sudo ./Pulseview.appimage ``` Set up a udev rule so normal users can access the device (recommended). See [How do I set up udev rules for Linux?](#How do I set up udev rules for Linux%3F) below for the udev rule and installation steps. ## How do I set up udev rules for Linux? Create a new udev rules file: ```bash sudo tee /etc/udev/rules.d/60 sipeed.rules <<EOF SUBSYSTEM! \"usbusb_device\", GOTO \"sipeed_rules_end\" ACTION! \"add\", GOTO \"sipeed_rules_end\" ATTRS{idVendor} \"359f\", MODE \"0666\", GROUP \"plugdev\", TAG+ \"uaccess\" ENV{ID_MM_DEVICE_IGNORE} \"1\" LABEL \"sipeed_rules_end\" EOF ``` ArchOS users use `GROUP \"uucp\"` instead. Reload udev rules and trigger: ```bash sudo udevadm control reload sudo udevadm trigger ``` Unplug and reconnect the device. You can now run Pulseview as a normal user. ## Why can't I use higher sample rates? Only 200M shows. The maximum sample rate depends on the number of active channels and USB bandwidth. Slogic16U3's USB 3.0 provides up to ~400MB/s. To use higher rates (400M/800M), disable unused channels. ## The device is locked in DFU mode and cannot switch back to SLogic mode. This usually means the SLogic firmware is corrupted, often due to a failed OTA update. **Solution:** Re flash the correct firmware via OTA. ## Cannot switch to DFU mode, error shows \"unknown USB device\". This indicates USB enumeration failure, often caused by poor quality or overly long USB cables. **Solution:** Try again with a shorter, higher quality USB cable."},"/hardware/en/no_translate.html":{"title":"no translation","content":" title: no translation class: md_page <div id \"visit_from\"></div> <div id \"no_translate_hint\">This page not translated yet</div> <div> <span id \"visit_hint\">Please visit</span> <a id \"translate_src\"></a> </div> <div> <script> function getQueryVariable(variable) { var query window.location.search.substring(1); var vars query.split(\"&\"); for (var i 0;i<vars.length;i++) { var pair vars[i].split(\" \"); if(pair[0] variable){return pair[1];} } return(false); } var ref getQueryVariable(\"ref\"); var from getQueryVariable(\"from\"); var link document.getElementById(\"translate_src\"); var fromDis document.getElementById(\"visit_from\"); link.href ref; link.text ref; fromDis.innerHTML from; </script> </div>"}}
