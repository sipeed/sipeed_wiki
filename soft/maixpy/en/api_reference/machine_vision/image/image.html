<p>For LBP descriptors, this function returns an integer that reflects the difference between the two descriptors. This distance measurement is particularly necessary. This distance is a measure of similarity. The closer this measure is to 0, the better the matching of LBPF feature points.</p>
<p>For ORB descriptors, this function returns a kptmatch object. See above.</p>
<p>threshold is used to filter ambiguous matching services for ORB keys.<br />
A lower threshold value will be closely tied to the key point matching algorithm. The threshold value is between 0-100 (int). The default value is 70.</p>
<p>filter_outliers is used to filter outliers for ORB key points. Feature points allow users to increase the threshold value. The default setting is False.</p>
<h2 id="HaarCascade-class-feature-descriptor">HaarCascade class-feature descriptor</h2>

<h3 id="Constructor">Constructor</h3>
<p>class image.HaarCascade(path[, stages=Auto])</p>
<p>Load a Haar Cascade from a Haar Cascade binary file (format suitable for OpenMV Cam). If you pass the &quot;frontalface&quot; string instead of a path, this constructor will load a built-in frontalface Haar Cascade into memory. In addition, you can also load Haar Cascade into memory through &quot;eye&quot;. Finally, this method returns the loaded Haar Cascade object, which is used to use image.find_features().</p>
<p>The default value of stages is the number of stages in Haar Cascade. However, you can specify a lower value to speed up the running of the feature detector, which of course will bring a higher false alarm rate.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>You can make your own Haar Cascades to work with your OpenMV Cam. First, use Google to search for &quot;<thing> Haar Cascade&quot; to check if someone has made an OpenCV Haar Cascade for the object you want to detect. If not, then you need to do it yourself (huge workload). For how to make your own Haar Cascade, see here For how to convert OpenCV Haar Cascades into a mode that your OpenMV Cam can read, see this script</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Q: What is Haar Cascade?</p>
<p>Answer: Haar Cascade is a series of comparative checks to determine whether an object is present in the image. This series of comparative inspections is divided into multiple stages, and the operation of the latter stage is based on the completion of the previous stage. Contrast checking is not complicated, but a process like checking whether the center of the image is slightly more vertical than the edges. Large-scale inspections are carried out first in the early stage, and more and smaller areas are inspected in the later stage.</p>
<p>Q: How are Haar Cascades made?</p>
<p>Answer: Haar Cascades trains the generator algorithm through positive and negative images. For example, use hundreds of pictures containing cats (which have been marked as containing cats) and hundreds of pictures that do not contain cats (which have been marked differently) to train this generation algorithm. This generation algorithm will finally generate a Haar Cascades for detecting cats.</p>

<p>The ImageWriter object allows you to quickly write uncompressed images to disk.</p>
<h3 id="Constructor">Constructor</h3>
<p>class image.ImageWriter(path)</p>
<p>By creating an ImageWriter object, you can write uncompressed images to disk in the simple file format used for OpenMV Cams. Then the uncompressed image can be re-read using ImageReader.</p>
<h3 id="Method">Method</h3>
<h4 id="imagewriter.size%28%29">imagewriter.size()</h4>
<p>Returns the size of the file being written.</p>
<h4 id="imagewriter.add_frame%28img%29">imagewriter.add_frame(img)</h4>
<p>Write an image to disk. Because the image is not compressed, it executes quickly, but it takes up a lot of disk space.</p>
<h4 id="imagewriter.close%28%29">imagewriter.close()</h4>
<p>Close the image stream file. You must close the file or the file will be damaged.</p>

<h3 id="Constructor">Constructor</h3>
<p>class image.ImageReader(path)</p>
<p>Create an ImageReader object to play back the image data written by the ImageWriter object. The frames played back by the ImageWriter object will be played back at the same FPS as when they were written to disk.</p>
<h3 id="Method">Method</h3>
<h4 id="imagereader.size%28%29">imagereader.size()</h4>
<p>Returns the size of the file being read.</p>
<p>imagereader.next_frame([copy_to_fb=True, loop=True])<br />
Return the image object from the file written by ImageWriter. If copy_to_fb is True, the image object will be directly loaded into the frame buffer. Otherwise, the image object will be put into the heap. Note: Unless the image is small, the heap may not have enough space to store the image object. If loop is True, playback will restart after the last image of the stream is read. Otherwise, this method will return None after all frames have been read.</p>
<p>Note: imagereader.next_frame tries to limit the playback speed by pausing the playback after reading the frame to match the frame recording speed. Otherwise, this method will quickly read and play all images at a speed of 200+FPS.</p>
<h4 id="imagereader.close%28%29">imagereader.close()</h4>
<p>Close the file being read. You need to do this to prevent damage to the imagereader object. But because it is a read-only file, the file will not be damaged when it is not closed.</p>

<p>Image objects are the basic objects of machine vision operations.</p>
<h3 id="Constructor">Constructor</h3>
<p>class image.Image(path[, copy_to_fb=False])</p>
<p>Create a new image object from the file in path.</p>
<p>Support image files in bmp/pgm/ppm/jpg/jpeg format.</p>
<p>If copy_to_fb is True, the image will be directly loaded into the frame buffer, and you can load a large image. If False, the image will be loaded into the MicroPython heap, which is much smaller than the frame buffer.</p>
<p>In OpenMV Cam M4, if copy_to_fb is False, you should try to keep the image size below 8KB. If True, the image can be up to 160KB.<br />
In OpenMV Cam M7, if copy_to_fb is False, you should try to keep the image size below 16KB. If True, the maximum image size can be 320KB.<br />
The image supports the &quot;[]&quot; notation. Let image[index] = 8/16-bit value to allocate image pixels or image[index] and get an image pixel. If it is a 16-bit RGB565 grayscale image for RGB image, this pixel is 8 Bit.</p>
<p>For JPEG images, &quot;[]&quot; allows you to access JPEG image color patches in the form of a compressed section array. Since the JPEG image is a compressed byte stream, the reading and writing of the data group is opaque.</p>
<p>The image also supports read buffer operation. You can treat the image as a section array object and input the image into all types of MicroPython functions. If you want to transmit an image, you can pass it to the UART/SPI/I2C write function, which can realize automatic transmission.</p>

<p>JPEG compresses the image appropriately. Compared with compressed save heap space, using this method uses a higher quality compression ratio at the cost of destroying the original image.</p>
<p>This method compresses the image, and then formats the JPEG data by encoding every 6 bits into bytes between 128-191, and converts it to OpenMV IDE for display. This step is done to prevent the JPEG data from being mistaken for other text data in the byte stream.</p>

<p>Create a copy of the image object.</p>
<p>Roi is a rectangular region of interest (x, y, w, h) to be copied. If not specified, the ROI will copy the entire image rectangle. But this does not apply to JPEG images.</p>
<p>Remember that the image copy is stored in the MicroPython heap, not the frame buffer. Similarly, you need to control the image copy size below 8KB (OpenMV) or below 16KB (OpenMV Cam M7).

<p>Set all pixels in the image to black or white according to whether the pixel is within the threshold in the threshold list thresholds.</p>
<p>thresholds must be a list of tuples. [(lo, hi), (lo, hi), ..., (lo, hi)] Define the color range you want to track. For grayscale images, each tuple needs to contain two values-the minimum gray value and the maximum gray value. Only the areas of pixels that fall between these thresholds are considered. For an RGB565 image, each tuple needs to have six values ​​(l_lo, l_hi, a_lo, a_hi, b_lo, b_hi)-the minimum and maximum values ​​of LAB L, A and B channels, respectively. For ease of use, this function will automatically repair the minimum and maximum values ​​of exchange. In addition, if the tuple is greater than six values, the remaining values ​​are ignored. Conversely, if the tuple is too short, it is assumed that the remaining thresholds are in the maximum range.</p>
<p>annotation</p>
<p>To obtain the threshold of the tracked object, simply select (click and drag) the tracked object in the IDE frame buffer. The histogram will be updated accordingly to the area. Then just write down the starting and falling positions of the color distribution in each histogram channel. These will be the low and high values ​​of thresholds.

<p>size is the size of the kernel. Take 1 (3x3 core), 2 (5x5 core) or higher.</p>
<p>If unsharp is set to True, this method will not only perform Gaussian filtering operations, but perform unsharp masking operations, thereby improving the image sharpness of the edges.</p>
<p>mul is the number used to multiply the result of the convolution pixel. If not set, it will default to a value which will prevent scaling in the convolution output.</p>
<p>add is the value used to add to the convolution result of each pixel.</p>
<p>mul can adjust the global contrast, add can adjust the global brightness.</p>
<p>If you want to set the threshold adaptively on the output of the filter, you can pass the threshold=True parameter to start the adaptive threshold processing of the image, which will be based on the brightness of the environment pixel (related to the brightness of the pixels around the kernel function). Set to 1 or 0. A negative offset value sets more pixels to 1, while a positive value only sets the strongest contrast to 1. Set invert to invert the result output of the binary image.</p>
<p>mask is another image used as a pixel-level mask for drawing operations. The mask should be an image with only black or white pixels and should be the same size as the image you are drawing. Only the pixels set in the mask are modified.</p>
<p>Return the image object so that you can call another method using. Notation.</p>

<p>The image is convolved by edge detection Laplacian kernel.</p>
<p>size is the size of the kernel. Take 1 (3x3 core), 2 (5x5 core) or higher.</p>
<p>If sharpen is set to True, then this method will change to sharpen the image instead of outputting only the edge detection image that has not been thresholded. Increase the kernel size and then increase the image clarity.</p>
<p>mul is the number used to multiply the result of the convolution pixel. If not set, it will default to a value which will prevent scaling in the convolution output.</p>

<p>The image is convolved through a bilateral filter. The bilateral filter smoothes the image while maintaining the edges in the image.</p>
<p>size is the size of the kernel. Take 1 (3x3 core), 2 (5x5 core) or higher.</p>
<p>color_sigma controls how close the color is matched with the bilateral filter. Increase this value to increase color blur.</p>
<p>space_sigma controls the degree of mutual blurring of pixels in space. Increase this value to increase pixel blur.</p>
<p>If you want to set the threshold adaptively on the output of the filter, you can pass the threshold=True parameter to start the adaptive threshold processing of the image, which will be based on the brightness of the environment pixel (related to the brightness of the pixels around the kernel function). Set to 1 or 0. A negative offset value sets more pixels to 1, while a positive value only sets the strongest contrast to 1. Set invert to invert the result output of the binary image.</p>

<p>Walk through the image and use the flood-fills algorithm to fill all pixel areas in the image. This effectively removes texture from the image by flattening the colors in all areas of the image. For best results, the image should have a lot of contrast so that the areas do not penetrate each other too easily.</p>
<p>seed_threshold controls the difference between the pixels in the filled area and the original starting pixels.</p>
<p>floating_threshold controls the difference between the pixels in the filled area and any adjacent pixels.</p>

<h4 id="image.remove_shadows%28%5Bimage%5D%29">image.remove_shadows([image])</h4>
<p>Remove the shadow from the image.</p>
<p>If there is no &quot;shadow-free&quot; version of the current image, this method will try to remove the shadow from the image, but there is no real shadow-free image basis. This algorithm is suitable for removing shadows in a flat and uniform background. Please note that this method takes many seconds to run, and is only suitable for removing shadows in real time and dynamically generating a shadowless version of the image. Future versions of the algorithm will be applicable to more environments, but are equally slow.</p>
<p>If a &quot;no shadow&quot; version of the current image appears, this method will use the &quot;true source&quot; background non-shadow image to remove all shadows in the image to filter out the shadows. Non-shadow pixels are not filtered out, so you can add new objects to the scene that did not exist before, and any non-shadow pixels in those objects will be displayed.</p>

<p>Correct the perspective problem in the image by 3D rotation of the frame buffer.</p>
<p><code>x_rotation</code> is the number of degrees that the image is rotated around the x axis in the frame buffer (that is, the image is rotated up and down).</p>
<p><code>y_rotation</code> refers to the number of degrees the image is rotated around the y axis in the frame buffer (ie, rotate the image left and right).</p>
<p><code>z_rotation</code> is the number of degrees the image is rotated around the z axis in the frame buffer (ie, the image is rotated to the appropriate position).</p>
<p><code>x_translation</code> is the number of units to move the image to the left or right after rotation. Because this conversion is applied to 3D space, the unit is not a pixel...</p>
<p><code>y_translation</code> is the number of units by which the image moves up or down after being rotated. Because this conversion is applied to 3D space, the unit is not a pixel...</p>
<p><code>zoom</code> is the multiple to zoom the image, 1.0 by default.</p>
<p><code>fov</code> is the field of view used internally before rotating the image in 3D space when performing 2D-&gt;3D projection. When this value is close to 0, the image is placed infinitely far from the viewport. When this value is close to 180, the image is placed in the viewport. Normally, you should not change this value, but you can modify it to change the 2D-&gt;3D mapping effect.</p>
<p><code>corners</code> is a list of four (x, y) tuples, representing four <code>corners</code> used to create four-point correspondence homography, mapping the first <code>corner</code> to (0,0), and the second A <code>corner</code> (image_width-1, 0), a third <code>corner</code> (image_width-1 image_height-1) and a fourth <code>corner</code> (0, image_height-1). Then apply 3D rotation after the image is remapped. This parameter allows you to use rotation_corr to do things, such as bird's-eye view conversion. E.g:</p>

<pre class="language-python"><code class="language-python">top_tilt = 10 # if the difference between top/bottom_tilt become to large this method will stop working
bottom_tilt = 0

points = [(tilt, 0), (img.width()-tilt, 0), (img.width()-1-bottom_tilt, img.height()-1), (bottom_tilt, img.height()- 1)]

<p>Return a &quot;similarity&quot; object, describing two images using the SSIM algorithm to compare the similarity of the 8x8 pixel color patches between the two images.</p>
<p>image can be an image object, the path of an uncompressed image file (bmp/pgm/ppm), or a scalar value. If a scalar value, the value can be an RGB888 tuple or a basic pixel value (for example, 8-bit grayscale of a grayscale image or byte-reversed RGB565 value of an RGB image).</p>

<p>Perform normalized histogram operations on all color channels of roi and return a histogram object. Please refer to the histogram object for more information. You can also use image.get_hist or image.histogram to call this method. If you pass the thresholds list, the histogram information will only be calculated from the pixels in the threshold list.</p>
<p>thresholds must be a list of tuples. [(lo, hi), (lo, hi), ..., (lo, hi)] Define the color range you want to track. For grayscale images, each tuple needs to contain two values-the minimum gray value and the maximum gray value. Only the areas of pixels that fall between these thresholds are considered. For an RGB565 image, each tuple needs to have six values ​​(l_lo, l_hi, a_lo, a_hi, b_lo, b_hi)-the minimum and maximum values ​​of LAB L, A and B channels, respectively. For ease of use, this function will automatically repair the minimum and maximum values ​​of exchange. In addition, if the tuple is greater than six values, the remaining values ​​are ignored. Conversely, if the tuple is too short, it is assumed that the remaining thresholds are in the maximum range.</p>
<p>annotation</p>
<p>To obtain the threshold of the tracked object, simply select (click and drag) the tracked object in the IDE frame buffer. The histogram will be updated accordingly to the area. Then just write down the starting and falling positions of the color distribution in each histogram channel. These will be the low and high values ​​of thresholds. Since the difference between the upper and lower quartiles is small, it is better to manually determine the threshold.</p>
<p>You can also determine the color threshold by entering Tools -&gt; Machine Vision -&gt; Threshold Editor in OpenMV IDE and dragging the slider from the GUI window.</p>
<p>invert Inversion threshold operation, pixels are matched outside the known color range instead of in the known color range.</p>

<p>roi is the rectangular tuple (x, y, w, h) of the region of interest. If not specified, the ROI is the image rectangle of the entire image. The operating range is limited to the pixels in the roi area.</p>
<p>bins and other bins are the number of bins used for the histogram channel. For grayscale images, use bins, and for RGB565 images, use every other channel. The bin count of each channel must be greater than 2. In addition, setting the bin count to be greater than the number of unique pixel values ​​for each channel is meaningless. By default, the histogram will have the maximum number of bins per channel.</p>

<p>Perform linear regression calculation on all threshold pixels of the image. This calculation is performed by the least square method, which is usually faster, but cannot handle any outliers. If robust is True, the Theil index will be used. The Theil index calculates the median of all slopes between all threshold pixels in the image. If you set too many pixels after threshold conversion, this N^2 operation may drop your FPS below 5 even on an 80x60 image. However, as long as the number of pixels to be set after the threshold conversion is small, linear regression is still effective even when more than 30% of the threshold pixels are abnormal values.</p>
<p>This method returns an image.line object. How to easily use linear objects, please refer to the following blog post: <a href="https://openmv.io/blogs/news/linear-regression-line-following"  target="_blank">https://openmv.io/blogs/news/linear-regression-line-following</a></p>

<p>x_stride is the number of x pixels that need to be skipped when searching for a color block. After finding the color block, the straight line filling algorithm will accurately pixel. If the color block is known to be large, you can increase x_stride to increase the speed of finding the color block.</p>
<p>y_stride is the number of y pixels that need to be skipped when searching for a color block. After finding the color block, the straight line filling algorithm will accurately pixel. If the color block is known to be large, y_stride can be increased to increase the speed of searching for the color block.</p>
<p>If the bounding box area of ​​a color block is smaller than area_threshold, it will be filtered out.</p>
<p>If the number of pixels of a color block is less than pixel_threshold, it will be filtered out.</p>
<p>If merge is True, all color blocks that have not been filtered out are merged. The bounding rectangles of these color blocks overlap each other. Margin can be used to increase or decrease the size of the color block boundary rectangle in the intersection test. For example: the color blocks whose edges are 1 and the mutual boundary rectangle is 1 will be merged.</p>
<p>Combining color blocks enables color code tracking. Each color block object has a code value code, which is a bit vector. For example: if you enter two color thresholds in image.find_blobs, the first threshold code is 1, the second code is 2 (the third code is 4, the fourth code is 8, and so on). The merged color block uses a logical OR operation on all codes so that you know the colors that produced them. This allows you to track two colors. If you use two colors to get a color block object, it may be a color code.</p>
<p>If you use a strict color range and cannot fully track all pixels of the target object, you may need to merge color blocks.</p>
<p>Finally, if you want to merge color blocks, but do not want to merge color blocks of two different threshold colors, just call image.find_blobs twice, and the color blocks of different threshold values ​​will not be merged.</p>
<p>threshold_cb can be set to call the function of each color block after threshold filtering, so as to filter it from the list of color blocks to be merged. The callback function will receive one parameter: the color block object to be filtered. Then the callback function needs to return True to keep the color blocks or return False to filter the color blocks.</p>
<p>merge_cb can be set as a function to call two color blocks to be merged to prohibit or permit the merge. The callback function will receive two parameters-two color patch objects to be merged.

Find all AprilTags in roi, and return a list of image.apriltag objects. Please refer to the image.apriltag object for more information.</p>
<p>Compared with two-dimensional codes, AprilTags can be detected at longer distances, poorer light, and more distorted image environments. AprilTags can deal with all kinds of image distortion problems, but two-dimensional codes cannot. In other words, AprilTags can only encode a digital ID as its payload.</p>
<p>AprilTags can also be used for localization. Each image.apriltag object returns its three-dimensional position information and rotation angle from the camera. The position information is determined by fx, fy, cx and cy, which are the focal length and center point of the image in the X and Y directions, respectively.</p>

The default setting is the best image.TAG36H11 tag family. Note: Each time you enable a tag family, the speed of find_apriltags will slow down slightly.</p>
<p>fx is the focal length of the camera in the x direction in pixels. The value of the standard OpenMV Cam is (2.8 / 3.984) * 656, which is obtained by dividing the focal length in millimeters by the length of the photosensitive element in the X direction, and multiplying it by the number of pixels of the photosensitive element in the X direction (for OV7725 photosensitive element In terms of).</p>
<p>fy is the focal length of the camera in the y direction in pixels. The value of the standard OpenMV Cam is (2.8 / 2.952) * 488, which is obtained by dividing the focal length in millimeters by the length of the photosensitive element in the Y direction, and multiplying it by the number of pixels of the photosensitive element in the Y direction (for OV7725 photosensitive element In terms of).</p>
<p>cx is the center of the image, which is image.width()/2 instead of roi.w()/2.</p>

<p>effort controls the time used to find a rectangle code match. The default value of 200 should apply to all use cases. But you may also increase detection at the expense of frame rate, or increase frame rate at the expense of detection. Note: If effort is set below about 160, you will not be able to perform any detection; instead, you can set it to any high value you need, but if the setting is higher than 240, the detection rate will not continue to increase.</p>

<p>For best results, please use a window of 640 length and 40/80/160 width. The lower the verticality, the faster the running speed. Since the barcode is a linear one-dimensional image, it only needs to have a higher resolution in one direction and a lower resolution in the other direction. Note: This function performs horizontal and vertical scanning, so you can use a window with a width of 40/80/160 and a length of 480. Finally, be sure to adjust the lens so that the barcode will be positioned where the focal length produces the clearest image. Fuzzy barcodes cannot be decoded.</p>
